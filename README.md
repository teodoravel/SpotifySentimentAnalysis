Spotify Review Sentiment Classifier
Project Goal:

The goal of this project was to build a sentiment classifier for Spotify user reviews, distinguishing between positive and negative feedback. Two approaches were explored:

Fine-tuning a pre-trained DistilBERT transformer model using Hugging Face.

Implementing a traditional NLP pipeline with TF-IDF and Logistic Regression.

Both models were evaluated using standard classification metrics, and key sentiment-driving keywords were extracted and visualized to gain interpretability into user feedback patterns.

Files Overview:
Laboratory_exercise_4.ipynb
This notebook implements and compares three different neural network architectures for predicting air quality levels based on a dataset of 5,000 environmental samples. Key preprocessing steps include:

Encoding the target variable

Feature scaling

Train-test splitting

The models differ in architecture (layers, activations, neurons) and are evaluated on classification performance to determine the best-performing setup.

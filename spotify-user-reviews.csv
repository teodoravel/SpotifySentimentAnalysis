A huge collection of music,positive
Downloaded music still can't be played offline as a premium user gg spotify u noobs,negative
"This app is the best music app I have ever seen but there are some covers which are not here like ""Sure thing"" by BLACKPINK and ""Clarity"" by Jisoo...Pls update those in the app...other then this everything is awesome â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸",positive
"Works great just with the car's Bluetooth, but not with car's radio app. From what I understand, Spotify has a ""car thing"" that they're pushing, so they've disabled the app from interfacing with most head units - both stock & aftermarket. The last thing I need is another device stuck to my dashboard. Pandora still works with the receiver's app...",negative
Best music app so far,positive
It was nice before you uploaded the old mood was good I prefer to back old one .,positive
Amazing! Works great.,positive
Only for paid users Dont waste your time in installation,positive
I love Spotify there are no ads if you subscribe which is worth every penny and there are hundreds of thousands of songs and podcasts to listen to and if you have children who like music there is a restricted setting. So 5 stars â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸ and 5 hearts â¤â¤â¤â¤â¤ for you Spotify.,positive
Personal playlists tend to play same songs over and over even when on shuffle.. despite the fact there are 1000s of songs in my personal playlists....,negative
Spotify is amazing it helps me fall asleep and wake up,positive
"Was having alot of issues, after deleting and reinstalling, it got alot better!!! Best app I have used(wasn't a fan of iheart radio and pandora)",negative
This app is brilliant every single song is here,positive
"Great app, using for podcasts mostly for now, nice and easy to navigate.",positive
It's really nice to use the app. Best app for song n music addictors BUT one huge negative in this app is ad experience it's totally made me cruel to hear the ad while hearing songs....à² ï¸µà² ,negative
very good ,positive
Good service with a great supply of music and podcasts. I'd like to see more asian music included in the supply. I've had one very annoying problem with playing downloaded content. Sometimes while I'm working in areas with limited data coverage I like to download music and podcasts in advance to be able to listen to them while offline. Too often I am unable to open the playlists with downloaded content which is a source of great irritation. I'd also like to see an option to disable video players,negative
Nice Music app op !ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ,positive
"Recently the app has been randomly losing the player. Can't close the app, can't stop what's playing. Argh! Been using the app for years and have loved it. This needs to be fixed - please! Update July 5, 2022 Seemed to have returned to normal until today - same issue. Am un-installing and re-installing.",positive
"I love this app, all my music in one place. I can make Playlist of my favorites and listen any time.",positive
Good,positive
It's cool but alot of times when trying to find some songs I can't find it,negative
Third class app I can't even login...its always failed to login,negative
Love the app Like my choices to listening to my favorites,positive
The app is decent even on a console but it is getting harder to listen to music with the ads. the bad thing is that you cannot control the shuffle on phones,negative
"Okay love the app and curated playlists, but you got to improve your cache clearance methods, having 1gb of cache behind for songs i may not play again is hige waste of space, and the amount of battery the app burns for running in background is really bad",negative
good app and good music,positive
Simply awesome. Quality of music is good. Best part is it's algorithm. Which u want to listen it just offers that in time. One thing to Spotify developers - pls enhance the music quality better than now. We want more quality. As of HD quality.,positive
Superb,positive
I LOVE IT GUYS!!! Every day listening!!!!only I think disadvantage is that not possible single song dowoad but full set it tracks.. At least I haven't found this option ;),negative
A big tease. I don't recommend. Way too frustrating to listen to a specific song after 'liking' it.,negative
1 advertisement after 2 song...just waste of time...never installing it again,negative
Spotify is really very good aap for music I love this aap,positive
"Come on, its spotify, its the best music app out there",positive
Great app for music.I thought that this was only for music but then I relised that it had stories too. The great thing about spotify is that it uses only a pinch of net.I will try my best to take premium membershipðŸ˜‚ Thanks SpotifyðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,negative
One of my Favorite apps of all time. Been using them for about 9 years now and they keep getting better !! I'm up to 30 hours of Amazing Tunes on my Markus Aurelius PL 1. Check it out and subscribe. You're gonna Love it I'm sure ðŸ˜€ðŸŽ¸ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶âœŒï¸,positive
"Cant choose what song to play, if i create a playlist it adds songs for me, and overall i have no control over my music now, at this point im considering soundcloud or Pandora........",negative
A very awesome app and the ads given are ok after one add we get 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening,positive
It's stupid that there is ads after every single song and the ads go for around 3-5 mins I don't understand it and I've bought premium and it did adds still,negative
"Stops playing every ten minutes +/- I love to listen to my podcasts while driving is during my train commute, but the recent update constantly interrupts playback, so I'll uninstall for now. It's a brilliant app otherwise.",positive
Good enough,positive
"This is the best music app because it has everything i want nice music, great playlist and much more so i will definitely recommend downloading Spotify ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜„",positive
Very problematic for mobile phone users. I hope they will make it as smooth as pc used app.,negative
This music app is amazing... Like it has the lyrics for every song and the lyrics are even time synced... Love this appðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–,positive
"So long as you keep Joe Rogan's podcast active and uncensored, I will be sticking around and supporting Spotify. Joe's podcast is really the only reason why I came to Spotify to begin with, given that before, I woud listen to his discussions on YouTube but then they decided to start chopping his conversations, taking things out of context, and of course, removing certain discussions based on no other merit than they simply didn't like the content. That's why I am here. Stay strong Spotify Team!",negative
"When it works its awesome. But sometimes it will just randomly stop playing a podcast. Also it will occasionally just refuse to play podcasts all together. I uninstalled and reinstalled and it didnt help. I signed out and back in, and it didnt help. The only fix i found was pressing play on a podcast and even though it isnt playing, to just let it continue to try i guess. Then after a few minutes the podcast would start to play. Ive used this method twice now. It worked both times.",negative
"Overall, I like the app, but I really wish they divided the artists' cut of our subscription among those we actually listen to instead of giving all my money to the most popular artists on Spotify (most of whom haven't gotten a single stream from me). What I want (and what small-medium artists want) is called a user-centric model, and what Spotify currently uses is called a pro-rata model. AFAIK all competitors do this too; it's a problem with streaming in general. But be better, Spotify!",negative
This app is amazing! The only problem is that it's SUPER glitchy if it's not immediately updated. Otherwise it's great,positive
"I changed my review because now my playlist has folders type thing and there is adds and i cant listen to the same song twice without stopping what I'm doing and putting it back on that song and I cant pay for premium and all I want to do is jam out well doing stuff and not be interrupted by an add and be able to play the same song twice:( (edit) I also want to be able to skip songs as much as I want or at least more then six times, I would be fine with 15 skips.",negative
"great selection of songs, easy to use, reasonable price, great interactions with users - I don't even use it as much as I should and I love it!",positive
This app is so bad don't download. If u play your favriout song it will start an anthoer song. Don't download,negative
love this app!!! podcasts also help me a lot.,positive
I think you should put an option for to add lyrics as some of songs don't have lyrics so it's better we have option we can add it ourselves.,negative
Stop hijacking my lock screen with album art! I don't want everyone to know that I'm listening to the Frozen soundtrack ðŸ˜‚,negative
Alot of songs are now being removed and now very boring app,negative
"Themusic is clear and atleast unlike YouTube, I'm able to use other applications whilst there is good music playing in the background.",positive
Really great app with loads of feature in their premiums.,positive
I love this app. It's part of my daily life,positive
1 Music to listen anywhere,positive
Great shows and consistent quality- and so much more!,positive
Love it no commercials and non stop music I like,positive
It's the best music app but the only problem are ads.They are long and very annoying ads....,negative
The playlists are amazing... The variety of music is top tier.. definitely worth every penny,positive
From creating yoga Playlist to finding ANY song from any Era to a wide selection of interesting podcast and topics... I use spotify all the time and highly recommend to family and friends!,positive
Disastrous update. Lost all controls for audio one track/playlist is selected. Plus gaps in playback. What the hells happened? Galaxy S10+ up-to-date Android.,negative
"Used to love this app, but since they started forcing Podcasts into the app, without letting you removing the recommendation and the f@#$ing AI continue to offer me religious and explicit content, I had to move to another app. I was a paying customer, and shame on you for taking a good music app and destroying the user experience. There is a feature request for three years with literally thousands of upvote yo let people remove the podcast section or at least hide some of it recommendation.",negative
I use this for shows like scrub and music only annoying thing is that it tells me that I have to have 1 hour to go back to 6 songs,negative
"Lower your ad volume, it's louder than the music... almost destroyed my 460$ headphones",negative
Great music available all the time.,positive
"Good streaming service, however the lack of lossless audio in 2022 is inexcusable",negative
Great app very stable with a vast library of materials to suit most people's taste.,positive
"I've had a fantastic time using Spotify,you can any artist or song into the search box & you be right at the artist album along with other singers or himself.",positive
"It plays more ads rather then the main music, if anyone want to buy premium they'll take it. Wth you've to again and again say the same thing take the premium, take the premium to enjoy music. Like i don't want to take premium why you've to again and again say that thing, fo smth with that ads please!",negative
"Just freezes all the time, shame the price and service dont match up,",negative
"I enjoy having the lyrics to many songs. It's nice to correct my ears' misanterpration of sound for many words. How new, after all these years. Thank you.",positive
The only thing I have a hard time with can't find certain songs but otherwise I like it,positive
"The new update is a big disappointment. It is so so so worse. The previous version was good. In this new version, you can't play a specific song from your playlist. You can't skip songs. And if you search a song, you won't get to listen to that song but will song dome random song. It is really disappointing!!!",negative
"Everything is fine except the pricing, I would be better to give some offers for customers to buy premium",positive
"Spotify currently does not recognize when it has internet and when not, refusing to play music even when on wifi",negative
I love it I find all my fave music n new songs that come out I like that if u buy subscription u don't have any commercial,positive
This app is really good. I am grateful that this app exists. I'm meeting new bands through him.,positive
Best music app out there other than apple Music.,positive
"Okay, this app is good over all, but it has it's bad things. First one is the amount of ads, after 2 songs it plays like 4 30 seconds long ads, and it's just annoying. Second, I don't know if it happens to android users, or just me, but when I'm using it on my phone the music stops by itself. Third, i had to delete an account because it had a deleted email linked and I couldn't change it since I can't have premium. You guys are just ""rude"" to free accounts. I'd be thankful if you changed that.",negative
I really enjoy using this app but some time it automatically stop but I like this app ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚,positive
This app Is very nice.It's do Good Work I am an army.I listen BTS SONGS I LOVE TO LISTEN BTS SONGS or sabse achi baat muhhe yeh lagi is app ke bare mai Ki songs ke sath mai lyrics bhi aate hai.I am satisfied with this appðŸ’œðŸ’œ,positive
One of the best music apps you can use no cap,positive
It is an amazing and absolutely satisfying app. It saves data as it don't need much and because of this reason I can listen songs after my data is over. It is also easy to use but there is one thing which disturbs the most and that is ads.The app shows too many ads. The ads are coming after every time. Please do something of ads. I hope you can do something with ads. Otherwise everything thing is perfect.,positive
"Brand new s22 and this is unusable. The mini player keeps disappearing from the app and notification bar. It says there's no internet available when there is. If I'm using offline mode and try to play my downloaded songs, I'll keep tapping a song and nothing happens, nothing plays.",negative
"I love that there are so many artists that I can add to my playlist that aren't mainstream or don't have radio play. My issue however is that lately, old songs that I've added can't be played anymore bc they have been grayed out for some reason.",negative
Amazing,positive
I can't skip music's? can't choose music of my choice ? damn you go too far just for not subscribing,positive
So many bugs after the last update... I keep having to restart the app...,negative
I just love how music is selected just for me,positive
"COVID warnings on podcasts now?? Are you kidding? 2+ years later? Now? Super LAME!! Download a podcast to play later, forget about it. Why? Because you NEED AN INTERNET CONNECTION!? Huh?? If it wasn't for Joe Rogan, I'd have bailed on this app a long time ago. it's so glitchy, unreliable, counterintuitive, stupid warnings. I have to force close it constantly & restart and sometimes it jumps to a totally random podcast maybe even a year old??",negative
Spotify is great!,positive
"So in 2020i think i installed spotify and it was awesome great experience, but now every time I wanna listen to a song its says advertising or whatever, it just keeps going on with the advertising thing, am I doing some thing wrongs here?? I really dont know it hard to use it beacause of that?",negative
"Great app, really easy to navigate. However, creating playlist and discovering new songs is a NIGHTMARE. They resently removed the feature to preview the song before adding it to your playlist, making it almost impossible to find new songs, which I really dumb. They should add it back. But it's alright for listening on car trips and stuff",positive
Love it! Can find most any song title or artist. Can customize playlists. Discover artists I'm unfamiliar with via recommendations based on my preferred music styles. Great app.,positive
Amazing i would say I'm not premium member but I didn't give it full 5 star because sometimes the ads are quite often to the point that there would ads after every song and other is that sometimes it just stops working it doesn't show me which song I'm playing so they fixed that i would rate it 5 star without being a premium member,negative
Spotify gives me the best mixes. I love it.,positive
I love the app but having a Playlist that is 3 hours long and only having it play the same 10 songs repeatedly is quit annoying.,negative
Crashes repeatedly. Has come to the point where it's not even worth fighting with to listen to music and podcasts.,negative
"Absolutely love this app, still worth It even without premium, get premium though.",positive
"the excessive amount of ads makes me not want to use this app anymore. apart from that, its pretty good",negative
New update. Hate! What is up with the new update. It's impossible to play it in my car. I'm about to invest into something else. Sad!,negative
"Love the service but I hate the app! I am waiting for minutes to play even downloaded podcasts to the point that phone just shuts app or I just give up waiting ! Playing stops randomly , I am listening to advertising even after paying membership. After every update I am hoping it gets fixed but it never does...",negative
Does what it's supposed to. Easy to navigate ... Easy to use.,positive
The app was working great until the latest update. Now the now playing bar doesn't always appear at the bottom of the screen. Please fix this!,negative
I like that I can create my own playlists and there's a wide variety of music to choose from,positive
Easy to use and affordable,positive
"Although for a long time I was reluctant to use a paying music service because of how badly the artists are treated, I have been growing more attached to using Spotify over the past year. It's too expensive, especially when podcasts still play ads regardless of your sub (seriously, not okay). Nonetheless, despite certain quality of life issues, I have considered it worthwhile until recently. Since the last update it is basically unusable. Fix it ASAP please, we pay enough to expect good service!",negative
"I love the sound quality, besides my playlists, Spotify suggests great new ones and searching for artists or songs is really easy. The searched song becomes a seed for similar songs. I love it!",positive
"One of the best music application I have ever used. But the only matter is with the advertisement, reduce its number so that the listeners can really enjoy your application..",negative
Spotify 5 music song is beast,positive
"the recent update is really trash ngl tho like my music can stop in the middle of nowhere and the notification where u can see which songs is playing can be seen at all, pretty sure other user do have the same thing going on as well....",negative
"So far the best music streaming App, ever",positive
everything was good until the new update i cant even download my songs just because i wasn't on premium and i cant skip songs i can only skip 6 songs per hour,negative
I just love this app!! ðŸ’•ðŸ’• thank you.. If l could l would give you 100 stars,positive
Useless uncloseable pop ups. The get the better experience popup asking me to enable bluetooth even though its enabled doesnt turn off. Surely this is an easy fix for something that causes constant notifications upon opening? Such a simple thing to fix. Its enabled. Everything is. Still there. Staring at me. Deep into my soulless heart. Fix pls,negative
"Nice music app, but the skips for free accounts should be more.",negative
"If you are looking for a music app I would highly suggest Spotify. It has so many genres but not only rap, r&b, pop, rock, etc but it has different categories in those genres and you can also see the latest singles or albums that have been released. I would suggest to get premium bc of the amount of ads you get. Also they have 2000s music, 90, 80, down to 50s. I like how there's albums from music you've listened to that maybe you haven't heard in a min or while.",positive
"Been using Spotify for years but with a Samsung S22 you can't see the play bar, it doesn't connect to other devices without issues. Glitchy and rubbish. I've been paying this service for years but if things aren't improved, I'm out.",negative
"I've been using Spotify for around 7-8 years now, it's where I listen to music everyday since :)",positive
Spotify gets me there with a smile Always 6days a week Spotify keeps me smiling on my daily train rideA-train BklynNY,positive
"Spotify is not only great for the music you love, but for the music you're yet to love ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ",positive
I sincerely don't have any thing bad to say about this app and I love this way they arrange their play list,positive
Since the new update my touch screen in my truck doesn't recognize Spotify. That was 90 percent of my use for it. I don't think I need to keep the premium subscription anymore.,negative
Tried the app again after a long time off it and what a change. The lyrics functionality is now present and the app is no longer buggy and slow. I still don't understand why we have to deal with podcasts though. New artist recommendation deserves a bigger spotlight (front and centre). Tour dates and merch is harder to find now. How about artist interviews and SM built in. Listening parties is still a mission. At this point it's just okay and barely competes with the other services. Music first.,negative
Every music app advertising but if we are not purchasing Spotify premium It hase more love with the advertising than songs.,negative
Easy and enjoyable,positive
"Great app for streaming music, have a great selection, and some hard to find stuff.",positive
Autoplay feature not working anymore. It's not working also on the Amazon Echo dot either.,negative
So far so good ,positive
My wallet was stolen my family account was downgraded due to the card not going through. I updated with the new card and resumed my family account. They would not let the other members of my family join because it had not been 12 months since they first joined. After an 1 5 hours with 3 agents the best they could do was to tell me they could join again in December (7 months). That is insane! It is the same people in the same household we just had to change payment! What a scam!! Canceled acct.,negative
"The app's new update sucks,you can't select a specific song to listen to, it's like am being forced to listen to a different song instead of what i've searched forðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®",negative
"1. I can't listen to anything without an ad every time 2. I can't find songs only the playlist they are in even then I have to watch an ad to skip the other songs to get to the one I want to listen to 3.when I want to see what's next on a playlist I can't check 4. If I go to a playlist I can't choose the song I want to listen now , it just gives me a small bit of the song",positive
Good experience but plz add more collection and play according to the mood,positive
The recent update has bugs. Music will play but the app does not show what is playing. I can't skip etc.,positive
"I don't need to hear religious ads, skip option should be available. Keep ads neutral.",negative
Very good,positive
There are some serious issues with this app lately. We pay for a premium family subscription. Why the app keeps stopping even though it shows its still playing is driving me crazy! I pay for customers to be able to listen to music at my events. It stops playing every time there is a new email or message or no reason at all. Even when I've downloaded Playlist or listening to a podcast. This has been going on too long. Please fix it!!! Looking to replace this app now.,negative
What is the point of making an app where you can listen music when you have to be charged MONEY to be able to play THE SONG THAT YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO? Turning off shuffle mode and playing an album or playlist that should be played in the same order it was supposed to be listened to shouldn't be a PREMIUM FEATURE. There is no reason for me/someone to use this app when they can't even be able to listen to an album/playlist in the order it was ment to be listened to WITHOUT ADDING SONGS ON THEM.,negative
"The music selection is fantastic !Everyone hates commercials tho,lol.Right in the middle of a good tune & then the music stops briefly for commercial.I can deal with some but they get annoying after awhile.Otherwise in my opinion,its the best music app in the business.I absolutely love it! 5 STAR ALL THE WAY!",positive
I really enjoy using this app but ever since the new version was updated i cant play an album without seeing the indiviual songs in there. If there is any way that i can change it i would really love that ðŸ˜,negative
Haven't been able to use it on mobile for a week since the last update!,negative
The new update is very buggy. Music randomly stops. Or plays without saying it is. Have to restart it constantly,negative
"Extremely sluggish app, takes a minute to start on a brand new phone. Also the CEO is a retard regarding music as something that only has one goal, profit.",negative
Songs in my playlist keep repeating. Only shuffling through a few then plays the song It played 2 songs ago. I pay for premium but will cancel if not fixed soon.,negative
"player bar not showing up anymore, player very buggy",negative
It is a good music listening app i love the interface and everything. But please add the option to change audio quality on wear os. It is so much worse.,negative
Would be five star if you can actually pick a song without going to a playlist,positive
"Best application for latest songs,music etc",positive
I love music that Spotify plays.,positive
One of the best music applications I've used.,positive
I already upgraded my Spotify but i still don't have the lyrics,negative
"When the app works, it's great, but a lot of times music will pause randomly or the app won't show which song is currently playing correctly.",negative
Why am I suddenly getting ads in Russian??? I have no idea what they are saying but it's happening on a regular basis. Explain yourself Spotify!,negative
"Shocking. What happened to Spotify? Okay so I can deal with a 30 second ad to have 30 minutes uninterrupted music, but what the hell is with the ""only 6 skips"" thing? That is absolutely ridiculous. Spotify 10 years ago used to be the go to place for streaming, a genuine company that didn't try to rake all the cash they could off people. Now it's just ""pay for this, pay for that"" Been around since spring 2009 but I don't feel welcome without paying. Such a shame, won't be using ever again sadly.",negative
"Love the clarity of the music, great selection, but for the love of whichever God you may pray to, can you stop changing the way liked songs works? I personally enjoy the selected genre option, but with it taken away it is much harder to find the songs I want in liked songs. I know Playlist exist, but I find that those are minimizing to what songs I would listen to otherwise. All around, a good app, but inconsistent.",negative
I've had Spotify premium for over a year now. Recently its started glitching and not playing as it should. It pauses randomly (on downloaded songs) and more. If i am expected to pay $12 a month for my music I'd expect to be working as it should,negative
Tried coming back to the app and I don't understand why the app has to be so confusing to use and why do I need to pay to listen to songs,negative
This sucks without Spotify premium you can't do anything. You can't listen to your favorite song. you can't listen to your Playlist in order. And you can't loop your song. Spotify is just terrible at least YouTube music let's me listen to my favorite song. So I think you should probably just download YouTube music instead.,negative
Absolutely the best experience app when I'm facing down mood.Through any song by using it without any charge,positive
Recently the app has started crashing and having numerous play back issues also if you want to make sure artists make more emoney than Spotify and Sony try Napster or tidal.,negative
It's good but the add is so annoying....,negative
Been on Spotify for years and years never had an issue and has every song you'll ever want,positive
Excellent database & search facilities. Also offline use & crossfade on windows desktop app. Unlike other streaming services. Only downside is still no cd quality or high res available. Unlike other streaming services. Come on spotify lets have it please.,negative
Beat music app. Awesome sound qualities. And super Playlist ðŸ‘Œ,positive
best music quality but not able to chose your songs individually without premium,negative
"I like to use this app for songs because I can play music while looking at other apps, saves my favorite music, makes a Playlist off what I like, which I loves that and it works for me",positive
"Day by day i am additected to this app . I have been using this app from 4 mounths and i can't really imagine how much i got involved with this app .. whenever i fell bore or when i make a journey with any kinds of transportation, i love to hear SPOTIFY. I can't ignore this app... Lots of Love from Bangladesh..ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©",negative
Great when it works. Becomes unresponsive when opening far too often. Sometimes it just randomly closes while playing. Takes a long time to load sometimes even though I have downloaded what I want to list to.,negative
"When I want to listen to songs other song are turning on like what? Fro example I want to listen hot milk, I click to play that song and its start to play other song.ðŸ˜ ",negative
Podcasts and audiobooks a welcome addition,positive
Absolutely satisfied. I would usually download music to my memory card until I found out about Spotify. All my fave songs from the 80s and 90s are all in here. I have strongly recommended this app to my colleagues and all have shared the same sentiments... Awesome!,positive
It's easy to get music on Spotify,positive
Best music app i have ever seen Love you spotify,positive
Logged out of my spotify account after resetting a password and now the app gets stuck at the launching/logo screen. Uninstalled over 10 times now. Still wont work. Have tried everything under the sun and cant get the app to launch. Honestly a bit ridiculous.,negative
Literally the best music streaming app,positive
I love song,positive
Unable to download music and yes I do have a premium account.,negative
"My original review was about the removal of the search tool. It's back now which is good. NOW they've removed Spotify connect support for JVC/Kenwood stereos! Can't even browse music or like songs from my car stereo anymore - just says ""Connecting"". STOP REMOVING FEATURES and actually add something... Something interesting for once! Tired of this constant deleting of features and moving things around.",negative
"Probably the best music app ever made, its only downside is that it doesn't have that much unreleased music",positive
Good for making playlists,positive
Very interesting. Easily connect me with my old time music,positive
it is just good not better then good because I just got premium and it didn't really work with no internet. then I searched up if you need internet for premium and it said no you don't. so idk what to do.,negative
Everything was perfect until my last update can't even play a single music or play the songs I've searched for,negative
It's a very good music app but it would be nice if the lyrics came in Tamil,positive
"The app keeps asking me to connect my devices(assume this is for data harvesting), why do I need to connect my device if it is already paired over BT? Debating on cancelling my membership and uninstalling if thos prompt persists.",negative
I really like listening to podcast on Spotify,negative
I love Spotify premium it's worth the price no commercials and you can download songs to play when you're out in the boonies ðŸ‘,positive
Very nice music platform,positive
"Honestly, this app is amazing! It allows me to listen to my music ad free for thirty minutes and it allows you to listen without all the bad quality! I bought premium and it's even better than you think. You may think I'm a robot, but I'm really not. (Totally not what a robot would say.) No, but seriously this app is just awesome and I don't even need wifi to listen to music now that I have premium. It has all your favorite songs! I encourage everyone to get Spotify and buy premium!",positive
"To Me this is the best music app ever, its easy great sound quality, there are many apps but Spotify tops them all.",positive
Wonderful! I've been with Spotify since you had to be invited to join.,positive
Worst lost of ad play one by one after one song ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,negative
It was gd. Bt some songs are not fully available and Some songs lyrics r not available.. So I'm posting 3 â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸rs... ðŸ™‚,negative
"Everything is great and I switched from apple music the only thing they don't have that apple music does is remembering if the user wants their music to be on shuffle, repeated playing for the Playlist or repeated song playing.",negative
20/12/18-Stops and closes randomly all of a sudden. It used to do this but then stopped for a while. Its done it 3 times in the last 15 minutes. Very irritating 20/5/21- 3 years on and this issue is back again after last update . 9/6/22- oh look its still happening. 4 years... Really???why am I still playing for this.,negative
Really efficient and easy to use,positive
Went down the drain. As the app updates rolled on the app got worse. Well once you took my Playlist I had and took the shuffle feature away to what was left. Well on I go. Pandora wins.,negative
"What's happening!!! My music stops, never happened before...I have premium and maybe I should reconsider this app, it was acting great! What the hell spotify!Spotify!!",positive
I'm yet to find another streaming platform better than Spotify. Warning! Once you go Spotify you can't go back,negative
"there's no play , stop, or next button. the songs randomly stopped",negative
Why are you forcing me to continue premium when I want the free version. This is nonsense!!!!. I'm going to YouTube music,negative
Cause when I set a password I have to go back in a change it and it's to many advertising on this site,negative
"If I could rate this a 0 I would, My name is Hannah and I'm 11 and I absolutely hate this app. I downloaded it and signed in made a playlist and what happend you may ask, well they added what they wanted onto it, it's so rude and when I tried to delete it of it said that I couldn't because they had picked it special for me, and it wouldn't let me play any other songs in my playlist, so just like that an hour after I down loaded it it's been installed an hour later. I'm never downloading again",negative
Lately after moving to preimum the app is buggy as hell won't load . Tried contacting the support through mail and all they can offer for support is uninstall and clear cached data. It's pathetic to say was on of the best apps now it's shite.,negative
I enjoy the ease of listening to my favorite podcasts and songs.,positive
Excellent music anywhere and anytime.,positive
Amazing,positive
"A simple, easy to use, very user friendly all. Build your playlist quickly and listen to your fav sing throughout the day",positive
"Everything is perfect with Spotify,just some and only some times it's will take your payment if your paying for premium about a few days earlier,but it's in general not a bad or worst thing, love this, had it for 4 years, no problems whatsoever, regardless if what any other idiot says",positive
Great selection of choices and remembering my listen to stations,positive
Totally recommended for music lovers and artists,positive
You cant even use it when travaling or if your visiting right across the freking border,negative
"What is wrong with you guy why are you trying to force us to buy premium. Can't skip for 1 hour after 6 time said to buy premium, ad popup between song. you decrease these things little bit I will delete the review then.",negative
Can't play Spotify when on WiFi,negative
"Very nice app made by what seems to be very nice people, just kind of noticed that while using the app",positive
Very Very Very good song app which good than any other apps I really like this app Very much because of the way you gave us to select and all continue by making so much apps thanks for making app,positive
App is User friendly with wide choice of music ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽµ. I recommend Spotify to the music lover's those who wish to listen the music Keep it up Team Spotify ðŸ‘,positive
Excellent music app,positive
I honestly don't know any other music app that's even comparable to Spotify. I've been with them for about ten years and cannot imagine life without it. Truly.,negative
I love it it's feel like the dj is on on the high volume sound if you were haedphone . I love it love it love it I am speechless enjoy â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,positive
"Absolutely love Spotify, easy to use, great choice of artists and making a playlist is so easy.",positive
Only app where the algorithm actually f**king works.,negative
Music pauses over and over without me doing it. It does it at random times and the enhance mode is also very bad. I delete a song off the enhanced playlist but it comes right back on while I'm listening to music.,negative
"5 stars until the most recent update. The app currently glitches more than it plays music. Constantly pausing randomly, or turning back on by itself, I don't always see the bar that shows what is playing so I can't control my music. It's actually incredibly frustrating. Please fix.",negative
It's good I love it but when I add songs to a playlist it randomly adds some songs. If you could make that stop thanks but if you can't sorry for wasting your time.,positive
"Covid vaccine propaganda push in this app is so ridiculous, i had to give it a 1 star and delete. App is terrible.",negative
"Been a customer to Spotify for years, it's the perfect app for music ðŸŽ¶ imo",positive
this is my favourite music and podcasts platform offers great experiences suggests related contents to enjoy for free even if we have the premium account it worth subscriptions we can choose the playlist by adding our favourite singersbands,positive
"The app has started logging me out when I restart my phone whereas it never used to. That in itself is only a minor annoyance, but when I try to log back in the app tells me to go online to complete. When I tap on ""connect"" I'm met with a black screen and nothing else happens. Can't really see any way around it but to uninstall the app and reinstall it. Again. Fix your app, Spotify. This never used to be a problem.",negative
Keeps saying go online to search when connected via mobile data. There's no way to refresh.,negative
Who can really fault Spotify? I use the paid version but it's very much worth it.,positive
This app is amazing and has all the best songs,positive
You guys are the bomb! I haven't tried a recording yet that you won't play. Thanks.,negative
"So slow and buggy. I've got this glitch in offline mode where it'll often skip tracks, not even one but 2 in a row. Basically imagine listening to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and it goes straight from Dark Fantasy to All Of The Lights Interlude. It basically makes the app unusable if you wanna listen to any album whatsoever. Can't believe I'm paying for this nonsense, app was working perfectly a couple months back, what happened?",negative
My most loved app. I wish I could get premium ðŸ˜•,negative
"It is good, helpful for me. But every single time I want to extend my premium access, I always have a problem with it. It always says ""Something error"" and I have to access it via laptop/web. It's not practical. When I am away and didn't bring my laptop, I have to wait to reach home to extend my premium access. Could you please help me? Thank you so much.",negative
Best but too ads,negative
I love this app the only problem with it is just when I have my own Playlist going it will turn on another song which isn't in it. Ads last a minute or two but they don't hurt at all. I would absolutely advise downloading this app for music and podcasts.,positive
Shuffle option is terrible only plays a select ammount of the songs in play lists on a loop.,negative
"I love Spotify because you can download any music you want with no ads popping up. You can listen to music even when your not in the app. You can play a game with music still going on. You can even make Spotify an alarm for you to wake up in the morning. Finally, Spotify is one of the greatest music apps I know and I hope you love it too; give it a five star ratingðŸ˜Ž.",positive
"Doesn't have everything I was looking for, but it has way more than I was expecting.",positive
"13.04.22 It used to be fine. As a paid subscribers, I don't understand why sometimes the play bar for the current song disappears completely, which means the option to skip forward/back isn't there. Whatever is playing can't be stopped, so have had to uninstall to reinstall again, this would be the 4th time in a week! I cancel my subscription as that's not what I was paying for. 14.04.22 4th time reinstalling today. DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP!!!",negative
I love Spotify great music and podcast.,positive
"If your not willing to spend money, don't bother. I got to listen to 1 song once and then it shuffled the songs. Every time I try to listen to the song again it plays something else because of the shuffle ""feature"". The only way to turn this ""feature"" off, is to get premium, which you have to pay for. Very disappointing.",negative
Loses downloads whenever phone restarts or freezes. Lagging hard.,negative
I rated it a 3 bc when I'm listening to music and I get out of the app it plays for a little while but then just stops,negative
I mostly use the app for exclusive podcasts like JRE and appreciate Spotify as company as a whole but the app crashes all the time. Frequently when I go to listen to a podcast the podcast doesn't come up so if it has video I can't see it or skip ahead or go back within the podcast its as if the app doesn't register its playing. If the app was more reliable I would like consider using it for music and upgrade to premium account but the frustration isn't worth it.,negative
I wanna give Spotify 5 star but lately a lot of my favorites song just gone. Just like that. It became unplayable. The song that mostly not on YouTube. I'm pissed off. I don't know who to blame but I will blame this app.,negative
"There is a bug in this app that has appeared only recently. I lose the ability to fast forward or rewind a podcast and can't even stop it from playing sometimes. I have to uninstall and reinstall to fix, but then it happens again after a day or so",negative
"Since the latest update, it becomes so buggy and constantly crashing, it's useless to use.",negative
"Since the last update the app is not holding the track position in my playlists, it keeps reverting to the start of the playlist which is a pain when some playlists are many, many albums long. If you could please sort this out I'd be very grateful. Thanks..",negative
Its a very nice app but I cant change what I'm playing on my phone yet on my tablet I can,negative
"It has virtually EVERY song I want, only a select few I have to go to YouTube for, so it's a really convenient app to have if you're a music junkie!",negative
The app is not working,negative
"Force Push App!!!!! Altho i closed all options so it will not connect and auto play, it forces autoplay!!! Minus 5 Stars!!!!!!! Immediately Uninstall",negative
"Free with commercials is an excellent app. It's the only way I found Country Music Star Creed Fisher, who's lyrics relate to today!",positive
Best online songs app ever..no regrets after installing..!!!,positive
everything is good but my question is i have so many downloaded songs then when i open the data it's downloading again i mean it's downloaded right? so why it's downloading again? sorry I'm bad in English but i hope you understand guysðŸ’—,negative
It is very good i could listen for days but the ads are annoying but you can get premium which is good I recommend using spotify,positive
"Does whatever it wants, it's easily the worst of the apps similar to it. It turns podcasts on or off at will and changes the podcast mid episode and loses its place which can be annoying to go back and track down where you left off. All this especially since 99% of the time I'm using the app while driving. Not a fan but I got a prompt to review the app so here it is.",negative
3rd class appp ,positive
Great sound quality!!,positive
The app is great. There a few reallly old songsbi just can't seem to find on it.,negative
Ok I can listen to my favorite songs and I don't need a premium I like the podcast,positive
"Since update on 5 Apr, the app has been playing up. For example, the stop button disappeared, only shows the play button. This means I can't control the play from my headphones",negative
This is probably the best music app ever just saying,positive
Update sucks!!! Been using Spotify for 7 or 8 years and with the past two updates I can no longer shuffle one genera of my liked songs and no I can no longer click on a artist and shuffle my liked songs by them... tired of paying for an app when the updates take away what I use most,negative
"Love this app so much. I can listen to music whatever I want, whatever I go and whatever I sleep.",positive
"I wanted to cancel my spotify premium, but it does not allow.",negative
When I try to play some music it crashes,negative
It keeps popping up a playlist for my songs. Spotify fix this I just want to listen to bubblegum b-. But it keeps popping up teen beats instead. I just want to listen to it please fix it. And everything is a playlist.,positive
"It seems everyone is experiencing the same issue as I am... sometimes the controls for the song playing randomly disappear. And the music will stop randomly too. I have to completely exit and close the app, re-load it, and then it works. Then the problem starts again in 5-10 minutes. Very annoying. I think the update caused the app to glitch.",negative
Great app. All my music is easy to find. Plenty more music to choose from too.,positive
GREAT,positive
"Doesn't have nearly as many features as the home/web player. Please add those, I want to be able to sort through my songs from date added. Please fix some of the design layout issues as well. Also, I'm wondering why I'm not able to download my liked songs or select more than one to add to a playlist?",negative
You get a good deal of unrelated music in the shuffle. I don't mind being exposed to new artists but if feels like the ratio is 3 to 1 in favor of the random songs.,negative
I wish this app was free you can't even see who likes you because you have to pay for it,negative
I really love it. I use spotify everyday! All my favourite songs are in this spotify. So I would like to hear it everyday whether I'm free or busy. If you guys want to hear a songs or podcast you can install this app. It's really amazing.,positive
Yes it's good cause i like jazz wt all my heart,positive
The best music selection and no commercials,positive
I love this app! I've used it for years and never had a problem with it. I would definitely recommend this app if you love music.,positive
"Has anyone at Spotify even tried using the app for podcasts? Absolute garbage. Downloads include the video + audio. Give me audio only. Can't listen to downloads if you don't have service; this is why I have to download it. The player is wildly unintuitive. Fantastic that they bought exclusive rights to podcasters so I have to use this garbage service. 4/25/22 - I maintain my 1 star review. Constantly crashes, randomly pauses, simply is the most aggravating podcast player I've ever used.",negative
"This app is ruined now. I pay a subscription for the app to randomly crash, songs to play with no sound and have to be restarted. I listen most days and I can't remember the last time I played a play list and didn't have to unlock my phone to restart the app or go back on to figure out why the music stopped.",negative
"I had no problems with the app until the last update. Many people described the problems, it's ridiculous, considering how much we are paying for it. I hope the issues will be resolved as soon as possible otherwise I'll be forced to look for a different music app.",negative
okay no one wants their playlists to be shuffled all the time bruh and those limited skips-,negative
Spotify's updated versions no longer work with Nuvo whole home audio systems and Spotify won't take action to address it despite there being significant awareness of this matter on Spotify's support forums.,negative
I would give it a five star like maybe a year ago it has very good service and all that but there is an ad after every single song there's like maybe one or two sometimes three ads that play after every single song It's too many ads and it's not fair for the people who want to listen to music but can't afford the no ads I just recommend maybe lowering on an ad every single time a song ends.,negative
Update: there was an update release that resolved the issue. I've corrected my rating to better reflect my current satisfaction with this app. Original Rating: I've had a family premium plan for years but the recent update has too many issues and makes me want to reconsider my music streaming service.,negative
The best music streaming service app I have been using for ages,positive
New to Spotify and love it. If you are thinking of subscribing and you are a music lover do it. It's amazing...,positive
Overall I'm completely satisfied with my experience using Spotify.,positive
Yeah good quality music. Would be good if my discover weekly actually pertained to similar genre's/artists that I listen to or follow,positive
I love listening to my favourite songs in spotify,positive
"It's significant for me, I highly recommend him ... But if there are some updates on widgets, It will be more great for me ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©",positive
Stops playing after one track??? Have to close and restart app to make it play again. Why??? I had to log out of app and delete from my phone and reinstall to fix the issue. This resulted in me losing all my downloads?! On a Pixel 5? If you can't get it right on vanilla Android when are you ever going to get it right?! RUBBISH!!!!!!,negative
"Even though this app is cool, one thing is, when I first got my phone, I instantly got Spotify and signed into my account, but when I found out I had no adds, (literally not one single add) I found out I was on ""family zone"" on Spotify, so I was exited and happy. Of you are new to Spotify then enjoy your new experience ðŸ™ƒ",positive
Love this versatile option for exploring and enjoying my music choices,positive
"Amazing, until hacked. But thats life I guess",positive
"This is the WORST app ever,if you don't have Spotify premium than you can't enjoy anything.the worst part is that whenever you want to play a playlist you can NEVER play it,there are many other songs that I'm not even interested in.Its TOO much overrated,the quality of the songs sucks, overall Spotify is the WORST app I've downloaded",negative
Very annoying and disturbing,negative
You are gonna hear more adds than song. I know there is premium in for add free music but for free it has a lot of adds sometimes 2-4 adds continuously.ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»,positive
Everything is now a premium feature I would request Spotify to make us listen to the songs by giving 200 to each song,positive
"The payed version is very broken, for Android at least. ""Download"" songs so you don't have to use data, oh but they redownload every day! Awesome. The app blew through my monthly data at one point because of this. Thanks, totally worth 120$ per year (sarcasm). The controls stop working regularly and require restart. Bluetooth control stopped working... Paying to not listen to what feels like 3 minutes of commercials between songs sometimes, and for them to not add things to your playlists..",negative
Best app for listening music and create good song suggestions,positive
"Great music app. The ads can be bothersome but premium settles that issue. Great catalog of artists and podcasts. Also great that I can use it on my PS4, pc and phone.",positive
"Fun and easy to use really, no complaints so far. So far I have managed to find what I need or want and I have not come across deceptive ads.",positive
"Itâ€™s the best App I have ever used for listening music. There are numerous options, playlists and specially blends.Spotify really knows me well. It creates playlists by my favourite songs which is appreciated. Artist mix,genre mix,mood mix these are so good. I like using Spotify. But I wish there were a few more advantages for those who use a free account. For example skipping more than 6 songs.",positive
Premium is the best music service available.,positive
I love this app bc it has any types of songs you can listen from here i recommoned to have this app! :D,positive
The music that I want to hear is on Spotidy. It is easy to find songs that you are searching for and the app also suggests other songs that you may also enjoy since you like the current song or album.,positive
"Is it the compatibility of the app and my phone, or my music doesn't play at all. I already updated the app, uninstalled and installed it, and even purchasing a one-day premium just to listen to music, but still it doesn't load.",negative
The same as YouTube. Though I can skip songs whenever I want.,negative
Whenever I close my mobile song automatically stop earlier it was fine. Please solve my problem,positive
The Spotify app is very user friendly and the Google Assistant incorporation makes it very easy to play my favourite music wherever I am.,positive
It won't allow me to skip songs and it regularly replaces my most viewed content with lesser viewed content.,positive
"Screwy since update, current song bar keeps disappearing, randomly stops music, actually the most annoying things to bug out",negative
Great music options and I don't mind the adds,positive
Can't choose which song you want to listen to without it being in a playlist and can't skip songs you don't want to listen to without getting premium. Very cringy app.,positive
"I used to love the app but when I search a song and play it, another song plays. In my playlist I don't want previews of the songs want to play, I want the actual song. Please fix this.",negative
Spotify app very easy to use. Nice selection of music.matching the music to my tast very good. excellent sound quality through my Sony Bluetooth headphones.,positive
"Awesome app with tonss of featuress. Managing your music queue, being able to save others' public playlists, lots of playlist management options and algorithms that suggest occasional bangers, and lots more!",positive
Music of choice available 24/7! Great!,positive
"Spotify as a platform is great. But the app for android is slow, glitch filled garbage.",negative
One more platform to promote your untalented family. Worst mixing of ur family songs in each playlist.,negative
"I've loved using Spotify every since I downloaded it, but just recently I've been having problems. Whenever I want to play a song on my phone, it just takes me to a random playlist and whenever I go on a playlist it's only on shuffle play (if anyone can help me with this, please let me know). Other than that, it's a really good app",positive
"I was excited to download this app; music is a LARGE contributor in setting my mood for any situation. Unfortunately, I quickly became disappointed with the Spotify app as I was reading the reviews. In all fairness, I did only read the first 10-15, but it was enough to decide at this time Spotify is not for me. The majority of the reviews had 1 star, and a couple had 2. I appreciate everyone's honesty! I'm not giving up just yet; I'll keep watching for better reviews. Thank you!",positive
amazing,positive
"After a while it won't play the full song when I click on it, and they add random songs to my Playlist that I don't want. Please fix.",negative
It'll become 5 stars if you guys can have an option to turn off lyrics. Nothing more aggravating than trying to swipe across for a new song and the app scolls down instead because of lyrics.,negative
"It's so buggy lately, keeps on crashing or not showing me what song is being played - so no way to pause the song without closing the app either...",negative
All my favourite songs and bands at a touch.,positive
Hands down best music app !!!!! If u dont like ads after every song than Spotify is the MUSIC APP FOR EVERYONE,positive
Love â¤ the way the music is selected.,positive
"The app works fine, but every now and then the app has to redownload some songs/podcast episodes; is not an issue but that is something to keep in mind.",positive
I just installed the new update and when I got into spotify to listen to my old songs they all changed I tried to find the original ones but they were gone why did this happen? This update ruined everything every song I liked got randomized and led me to a diffrent song I had no idea about and that is not a good thing. You screwed up and I'm going to a diffrent app,negative
"My fav app, can't do without it even for a day!",positive
Its so differentand easier to find my music Thank You ,positive
Best music streaming app clean and very friendly user interface by far the best algorithms to find new music based on your past listens and the annual insights feature is awesome signals that Christmas is really coming,positive
"Spotify is such a great app, which makes finding and experiencing music so much easier. I love it.",positive
One of the greatest app for music lovers but why does some are unable to hear,negative
"The app keeps crashing. It was working fine before the last update.... Fix it already... Having to constantly restart it , is irritating...",negative
It's quality band easy to search musiv,positive
It's been fine albeit a little bit buggy for the past 2 years I've used it but recently Spotify has been trying to download music over mobile data. (even though I have the setting turned off),negative
"Every time I want to use this app since the latest update, I have to uninstall and reinstall it because the play button stops working. Please fix it.",negative
It used to work great. Now its buggy and needs internel to play the songs i've dowbloaded. Why am I paying thise?? Its not the app i used before.,negative
"Everything had been good for the 5 months after I got a new phone and decided to use Spotify but the last 2 days have been very bad. Spotify shows 'no internet connection' whenever I open the app and would like to download or search for music, and I'm unable to visit the Spotify address on the web. Spotify is the only app on my Pixel that behaves this way. Kindly fix this issue, thank you.",negative
You can search for any music so awesome,positive
A very good one app tjat i found without publicities while listenning,positive
Phone app is broken again. Keeps shutting down while listening,negative
Currently bugged on many flagship phones including Pixels and S22 series devices. Playback controls disappear after a few minutes and you must relaunch the app in order to control anything related to playback.,negative
It's good but the thing to switch over for driving it won't work I have to disconnect my Bluetooth for it to register,negative
I love Spotify Its the best music streaming app ever Ive had no issues with it  Im a premium user so its great for me no ads no nothing I love it ,positive
I can't even play the songs I want anymore. I used to use this app a lot but now I barley use it. Everything I play goes to a shuffle and when I play songs it crashes.,negative
"Awesome, it has every song you want",positive
I was very happy with Spotify until the app refused to stop playing episodes and I was unable to change between them. I was forced to uninstall the app in order to stop the audio from playing. Now that I'm trying to re-install it refuses to do so.,negative
The BEST music app EVER!!!!,positive
"Device- Vivo x80 pro, Android v12, this app automatic crass and I open this app and play any music then crass . Please fix this problem.",negative
The play/pause button no longer shows up on pixel 6 pro,negative
"I with everyone else. It's buggy, shutdowns, boo man fix this.",negative
Really this is my first rating app. In this app there was lot of song. Which is I never listen in any app. This app was really awesome,positive
It's all good but ads are just a little annoying ðŸ’€,negative
Good music 100 ðŸ’¯ clear sound,positive
I love the lyrics for karaoke ðŸŽ¤ and hot they put them on the screen so you don't have to go searching them up,positive
This app is hella trash the update ðŸ’€ first really listen anytime until when i play my fav song and theb why the tf is the song changing i was like is this a glitch hell Nah ðŸ’€ im gonna delete this asf bc it's getting boring ðŸ’€ and the music is also wrong ðŸ’€,negative
Best listing app for music by far!!!@,positive
I'm literally only here for Joe Rogan. I've had premium for the past 6 months because I got it for free with my phone. I have never seen a glitcher app with this much popularity. UPDATE: Still broken UPDATE : randomly skips episodes and loses my spot,negative
The music you sent was good. You have me considering making a pod cast. I have a lot of truth to share. Like Kincade cavern In the Grand Canyon. So many parts of our history has to be revealed. And the truth be told. In Gen 5:2 where did Enoch go?,positive
There was this update or something now i dont know how to choose the song i want to listen to! Its playing random songs in my liked playlists. I absolutely hate it now cant even reset the song either,negative
"Very Good, hope if you people feature the multicoloured skin themes options as well in it",positive
You can read the other reviews I've also had problems with the display of what you're listening to and it just constantly pausing,negative
"such a good app, with or without premium they have lots of songs and i know it can be a little annoying when spotify adds songs to your playlist but the songs they add are based off your recent searches so theyre not even bad songs and at least when you watch and ad you get rewarded with 30 mins of uninterupted listening! they have basically every song. such a great app... and its free too!",positive
Best music app I ever see,positive
Very very bad experience it only allows us to hear a particular song repeatedly....only when we have a playlist we could hear our favrt song rather than that it plays the same repeated song and from some particular movie ....it makes me very irritating while hearing the same set of song again again,negative
Paidd for premium with mpesa function twice and didn't get premium features why?,negative
Doing too little too late for spreading misinformation during the pandemic.,negative
"SPOTIFY IS TERRIBLE! Before podcasts, Spotify was fantastic. Today? utter disaster. The user interface (UI) is so bad that I am honestly in awe. If they go back 2-3 years, they will improve the quality of their app by a good margin. Sadly, they also support misinformation, they force content on premium users, and there is not even a way to edit the home page! I resorted to having my playlists as widgets, I simply open the app directly to a playlist, and never see more of the app. And the icing on the cake? remember the days when you could call Spotify and complain? well, those days are gone. They do not have a line to call. They are just terrible, for no good reason. Lastly, as someone with ADHD, who absolutly *needs* simplicity, this app is one of the worst there are (although most apps seem to travel the same way - down the drain).",negative
This is an ok app but it lacks features that you can get on the PC version like the ability to play a certain song or repeat a song.,negative
"Room for improvement... It would be great if the app asked for confirmation before deleting songs from playlists, etc! Sometimes I misclick then it's gone forever. That's my biggest complaint, otherwise a great app",negative
"The update is honestly WAAY too restricting.The forced shuffle feature on every user that isnt on premium is just...so unappreciatedable to the point where its clear that,the only target is money. But if you just wanna listen to music this app would be alright, The quality of the songs that are played are great besides the whole forced shuffle thing",positive
It's nice playing songs YOU want when YOU want them DESPITE the ads that make them FREE!!,positive
"The ads have become absolutely overwhelming. Playing far too often compared to the music received. Some are incredibly annoying, such as the single earbud Snickers ad. I understand the push for subscription, but I might as well throw YouTube on in the background instead of Spotify. Less frequent and shorter ads with more customizable music options.",negative
LIKE THIS,positive
Best Music Streaming App,positive
"Very worst app, I got too much of ad when move to another song. I wish to say use offline music app for better Experience",negative
Just recently been using a Spotify premium trial and i can't even use it without the app force closing itself when I'm using another app fix it,negative
Music ,positive
Love this app! Daily user on free version. Ads not to bad considering how good app is,positive
App works well although a little wonky at times but that could be my phone as well overall pretty happy with the music and the playlist that they put together,positive
Is the best app for listening music,positive
So groovy I love Spotify. . I used to by CDs and neglect them. Can't scratch the internet!!!,negative
"I love Spotify! I use it for my personally and for my business, I love how it's easy to use and some of the Spotify playlists are perfect.",positive
This is really a good application for song lovers the only reason i couldn't give it 5 star is because the ads are just a bit long so i hope it can be fixed overall the app isn't bad and pretty good,positive
So far so good,positive
"I actually love this app, the only reason why I gave it 1 star was bc it might get more attention than a 5 star rev. There's one major issue that annoys me and a lot of the people I know who use spotify to broaden and shape their music library/collection... Which is the fact that u can't hide/dislike music, e.g. artistsWho apparently are ur favorite bc u went through all their music to check it out OR album picks that actually aren't related to your taste but only disappear after a taste shift",positive
I've been waiting for canvas to launch on all devices for so many months now. It's honestly infuriating. All my downloads vanished today even though I only cleared the cache and added my premium plan back before it expired. It's an otherwise ok app.,negative
What happened to the Spotify Session scan feature?? This is not any better. It used to be efficient to scan in the app directly.,negative
"Brilliant app!!!can you please get proper support and I pressed log out by mistake and it logged me out of a family plan, so pissed, please add a are you sure option if you press log out.",negative
i love you Spotify ,positive
"Very nice, but l can't download music on it",negative
Application is. Not supported when I open the app the. Send me on my fone home screen,negative
Worst app. Too much of adds. Sooo irritating. Guys insted of this app go with gaana and wynk.,negative
"I was happy in the beginning. But now I will discontinue the subscription just because of a new change, all the songs even the one's I've downloaded offline are going grey in few days, unplayable if I don't connect to Internet. I work on a ship, I don't have access to Internet always, as soon as I connect it starts downloading which I don't want. All of us don't have access to high speed Internet all the time, what's the purpose of having songs offline then?",negative
Great lots of music 14-18 has cuss words but overall super good quality not alot of ads only one per 30 mins,positive
"The shuffle feature doesn't shuffle very well and tends to play the same songs every time I shuffle a playlist. Other than that, it's a great app! I love the recommendations!",negative
Listening activity should there on phone too,negative
So good you can listen to it when the device is even off,positive
Love it. Been using Spotify for years!,positive
Free music as it is to buy. Listening to real recordings of artist not someone's copy or stolen mp3. Pay for no ads and listening to what you want anytime.,negative
I love this app but I really wish you didn't have to shuffle in the free version on Android. The default option on iOS is play(even without premium) and not shuffle play so why is it different for Android?,positive
"It REALLY wants to push you to listen to community/automatic playlists and podcasts. As someone who likes to listen by the album, or occasionally a single song, the interface is incredibly convoluted. I don't want to discover songs, I just need to play them. Only good thing is the music selection, they have some very obscure bands here.",negative
"Recently the music just stops playing all the time, and sometimes randomly starts again. Sometimes my controls (play/pause button) disappear now. So disappointed. I used to love Spotify.",negative
"App has suddenly become horribly unstable. Frequently, a new song will start, but the notification won't update. When this happens, the app will only open as a black screen and the only way to stop music is to force stop the app. Have tried all the usual troubleshooting, cleared data, reinstalled, etc. but this still happens almost every time i listen to music with the app.",negative
"I basically use this only for podcasts. It does the job well there, but needs to improve in then songs department. Most regional songs do not have lyrics. And the ads are annoying.",negative
Premium user. Now I can't play song previews or even listen to the songs when adding new songs to my playlists. Spotify sucks now!!! try another platform first.,negative
Premium is the best thing since sliced bread for me. Nothing I could actually think of to improve.,positive
Until this week I was enjoying the free access to spotify. Now it cuts out halfway through a song and the tool bar showing which tracks are playing has gone which means that I cannot pause the track and deal with real life when it entrudes. Was able to pause a track and restart it after i had a lunch break. Have you wizzards updated it to a crapper version? Downloaded a new version it seems to get worse. However on the upside don't seem to be getting adverts including the mumbling one .,negative
Quite a good app also I'm not bothered by ads but when it gives two ad atta time it triggers me also the new option for sharing the lyrics isn't available on my device yet I've reinstalled and also updated it several times but that doesn't seems to do anything so I'd like y'all to take action on these things and overall I recommend it,positive
Whatever kind of songs you want are there. No stress of downloading songs.,positive
All the music and podcasts I want and after you pick some songs it finds amazing new songs for you to listen to,positive
Still the worst app on my phone. Playback stops all the time. Downloads take forever. If it wasn't for Joe Rogan I'd definitely never use this app,negative
I am a premium subscriber. Keeps crashing for me since a recent update a week or so ago. Sometimes takes upwards of 10 mins just to get the app open.,negative
Unable to see 'now playing' and controls at the bottom of the screen. Music continues to play even though earbuds/speaker is kept/turned off.,negative
Nice songs collection but problem is after downloading the songs without internet it's not playing for that we need internet too.,negative
very good just wish their were less without having to pay,positive
Spotify is so much better than Amazon music you really do get your bang for your buck,positive
I used the free Spotify for years and have found it easy to navigate and loved it which is impressive since Im not great with technology The only complaints I had were I couldnt skip more then 2 songs on my lists and after 2-3 songs 2 min of the same adds would interrupt whichs annoying but manageable My kid bought me a subscription as a Xmas present and I must say as a frugal person its well worth paying for the subscription I recommend bucking up the  its great,positive
"Ads are too long, shuffle play is not good.",negative
"this app is so very annoying and i donâ€™t really like the new update of the app. we want the old one were we can listen all the musics we want just for free and not building a choice wherein, you have no choice but to buy premium. THE CREATORS ARE TOO GREEDY! This app sucks, bring back the old Spotify we knew before.",negative
"Recent problem where app does not show the player, so can't pause, check queue etc. Have to restart phone (Android - Samsung Galaxy) to get player back, but it soon disappears again.",negative
Spotify has the best user experience,positive
absolulty love it got rid of my itunes for this,positive
Awful i hear more ads and less songs,negative
My Spotify app is always on. And it's amazing that Spotify notifies me when my favorite artists are touring.,positive
"I love Spotify, but the app has not been working right lately. The controls are not available when out of the app, it will start playing on my phone randomly unprompted, and won't Bluetooth properly to my devices. I know I'm not the only one having these problems. Please fix",negative
Love have splotify premium not to expensive love how I can go offline and download music. Using the car mode is easy makes everything bigger all in all would recommend trying premium,positive
I love this app but only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because sometimes the music that I download doesn't actually download it just downloads to the Spotify I would like to be able to put it into my phone save to my phone if possible.,negative
Amazing app best app for listening to music ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµ,positive
I've been using spotify for years and find the app really amazing and well made. Yes I have come across some bugs and shortcommings throughout the years but nothing majour that hasn't been effectively resolved.,positive
Easy for a novice to use!,negative
"Don't use often enough to make paying viable so use the free version can be a bit anoying with strange adds, but still ok.",positive
In free version there are too many ads but after upgrading it to premium it's just amazing,positive
"This app is almost unusable now. When I try to play a whole album it skips ahead randomly, will stop playing. I've been a premium user for 14 years, this is the worst it's ever been",negative
Spotify is really a boon for music lovers Have enjoyed listening to my liked list on repeat mode. But it is really disturbing to have 2 to 3 ads after 1 or 2 songs everytime. It will be good if the frequency of ads is reduced and there is more of music,negative
"Honestly, I like spotify, but I've noticed a new bug: When I don't use spotify, and cancel any music, random music starts playing every 1 or 2 hours. This never happened to me, a few months back. Now it's happening constantly",negative
"This app continually selects shuffle, even though I keep turning it off - why?",negative
Best music platform i have ever used,positive
"Would be a good app, but for some reason it randomly crashes and closes, the song then restarts. It's really annoying and I'm not sure what the problem is? I checked the permissions and I have allowed everything, so maybe it's just a bug...Whatever the case is, please fix it.",negative
Second or 3rd year it's simply amazing made for us just like reading my soul!! intutive and satisfys the mood! they choose wisely try it! real music lovers best bet yet! finally something on this dang stupid smartphone works like it should!! Im 61 and many genres open minded and really hate my dumb thumb on small screens I have enjoyed spotify 110% ! really try it out it can do! finds all my old favorites! Im Theo.Tainter and I Approve this message...its a Promise bro's& sisters! OK 4th year!,positive
"Like everyone else, my app plays without a playbar, making it useless. Spotify code scan ads still work flawlessly of course. I think Spotify has run its course. Looking for that new thing.",positive
"Good sound quality, and have good celection of Music re recommend for all, Peace On Earth!",positive
"Have loved this app for years but all of a sudden, volume drops almost in half about every 10 minutes. Cannot figure out why. Will cancel premium unless fixed. So annoying and please help!",negative
Turn off the covid warning rubbish. The world has moved on. Clogging up my podcast feeds. Close to unsubscribing.,negative
One word amazing Though it would be helpful if some updates is made to the sort options and if one can search for songs by lyrics,positive
Spotify is very good aap for listening music,positive
"App won't go to log in screen, just shows splash screen",negative
Why so many ads bruh.,negative
makes work much easier great app,positive
Started with no adds and now it's full of adds after every song. Can't skip adds when connected to earphones while driving But overall helps with lyrics Should integrate with apps like sound hound so that we can find the song in Spotify when we hear the tone anywhere anytime.,positive
Recommended by a stranger once and has been a good app to use,positive
Spotinazi stole my money. I had premium subscription for a year until 06.04.23 and it's just been deleted. Scammers,negative
"Recently transitioned from Apple to Samsung (IOS to Android). While the UI is the same, the back end is a different story. The IOS version of this app is far better and more responsive. On this device (S22 Ultra), I cannot scrub through songs via Bluetooth on Ford Sync, the function does not work. When I scrub through songs manually through the app the bar moves but the song remains at the same spot. When I pause the song the bar goes back to the original position. This need to be fixed.",negative
Fix ur App These playback issues are outrageous. Also for the love of everything holy allow me shortcut scroll to the current song playing in a playlist,positive
"I can't buy premium, it always unable to connect pls fix this",negative
"Annoying popup requesting to allow Bluetooth cannot be hidden permanently, just ask later option, which isn't a choice at all. Looking at moving to Deezer.",negative
Nine out of ten days it works fine. One out of ten days the app crashes constantly. Everyday the app struggles when entering orvleaving wifi coverage. Honestly once I find a better option I'm out.,negative
Bro if I search up a song then play that song stop shuffling and playing a random song. Also if I want to shuffle my playlist then I will do it don't do it for me,negative
Honestly great. It's the best music app I've ever used. Highly recommend.,positive
"I absolutely love Spotify, especially the feature that allows you to listen to certain like genres of music, except it hasn't been working lately. Like I would select country and Christian music would start playing or I'd select rap music and musical would start playing. The apps genre play feature in liked songs is not working at all!",negative
Good app with little interruptions,positive
I enjoy listening to music and walking,positive
The app is very slow and stopped working so I contacted customer support and was passed around to 8 people who all just kept telling me to logout and login again and Uninstall then reinstall. In 5 hours 1 person actually was useful until they just asked dumb questions again. I have not been able to listen to anything since right after I was billed and when I asked for a refund it said I couldn't bc is was past 14 days but I paid on the 6th and it's the 19th so it hadn't even been 14 days.,negative
Absolutely brilliant music especially the song from shaya richie. Will recommend the channel Spotify to all my friends and family.,positive
"I listen to news and education content, but mostly news because I get very little news in my area so this helps to fill the media that's lacking.",negative
I love to play Spotify ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š ðŸŽ§,positive
My experience has been phenomenal.. I no longer have to search for songs I like.. The free trial was amazing to. I was encouraged to go for premium at only 3. 99 dollars ðŸ’µ per month,positive
"It's fine, I'm enjoying the music.",positive
Spotify has a good selection of music and as a member you can build playlists of any genre you could come up with.,positive
Put landscape view back in the app for now playing,negative
"I have used spotify for years now and ive always been satisfied with what it offered but since the latest update, it has got worse. If I want to create a playlist, I no longer can play ""a bit of the song"" to see what song it is because mostly, you dont know the songs' title. Please fix this!!!!!!",negative
From last update music cast is not connected,negative
"Never saw my rewind because their support email kept saying ""try refreshing and come back if that doesn't work"" and when you'd come back, if perchance they did decide to reply to you, they'd say ""try refreshing and come back if that doesn't work"" :/ great. The only reason I've still got Spotify is because Pandora is so horrible but just because Walmart is better than the dollar store doesn't mean it's Good.",negative
Downloaded podcasts don't play all the way through without internet. It completely defeats the point of downloading...,negative
"HORRIBLE!! If I could give zero stars I would. This stupid app automatically starts itself on my phone all the time, and I DON'T USE THE APP!! If I used it a lot, it would make more sense, but I stopped a long time ago. My only answer is to uninstall.",negative
Incredible. Smooth & simple usage plus valuable content...thanks for this amazing experience...:),positive
Recently when I am playing a song it doesnt show what I am playing and the song controls are missing. Quite annoying,negative
"The ads are a bit too much, I get almost 3 ads after every 2-4 songs which is extremely annoying. Everything else is amazing",positive
30 minutes of ads for 3 minutes of music :(,negative
It's great app but now it keeps crashing smh,positive
When I go on to my play list it will play a completely different song so can you change that thanks,positive
"Loyal customer of 6 years, they took a lot of my money but I think it's well worth it.",positive
"When I first got spotify it was pretty flawless, never had an issue. It would play with out fail and never cut out at random moments. But as of the past year I have been noticing more and more flaws. Sometimes music wouldn't want to play, or it would play but it would cut out at random points and pause my music. It would be nice if Spotify fixed all of the issues. Bc like I said it used to be flawless.",negative
I wish you could still make collaborative playlist and not have to invite people to collaborate. Before you could just make the playlist collaborative but now it's gone ðŸ˜•,negative
"Aside from my account being regularly hacked and me having to remove people on a weekly basis hat i dont know,I have now lost all controls in app and on widget, no way to pause or stop, plays of you tap a song but still no control?",negative
"Cancelling my subscription. I've been experiencing too many issues and been quite about it for too long. I have no idea what is going on now. Music just randomly stops and starts. Oh and the absolute worst! The Now Playing interface doesn't pull up when I start playing a song, so I can't skip replay or pause a track!",negative
"The application is good, i play any music i like with lyrics",positive
it's horrible every song is tied to a shuffle and when you make a playlist spotify adds song you didn't ask for. Just use the ps4 version it's way better.,negative
"Unethical business practices for artists, and the whole concept of not being able to play specific songs on the app when listening to ad-supported music when you can easily do so on the desktop is more money-grubbing BS we've come to expect from spotify",negative
Great source for all music types,positive
I liked it but for me it doesn't let me look at the lyrics idk why tho also it only shows the story line of the song but not the lyrics can someone help me?,negative
"Well, the app is actually real good, except for the annoying ads after 4-5 minutes. Every time, after two songs play, there comes whole 3 ads, which just completely ruins the mood to enjoy some good music. Everyone cannot afford to have premium, so it's really not pleasing for people without premium to enjoy music here. Ads are okay, but the amount of it...it's really too much. Hope this matter gets looked over, because I believe there are many users facing this same problem.",negative
Number 1 aap in all music apps,positive
I love Spotify BUT the player controls that allow me to fast forward and rewind fails frequently.,negative
"New bug where music option dissappear, I can't change, pause rewind or skip, have to delete app to get it working",negative
"The mobile app just fails to track the song I'm listening :( So, no menu I can use, nothing in notification area as well. Please fix!",negative
Very much satisfy,positive
I get to listen to all kinds of music and podcasts on it and so far it has been seamless.,positive
"Songs lag on wifi, i have 200 mbps connection and songs lags a lot in between, on 4G it's OK but Spotify sucks on wifi",negative
It's so good for listening musics and podcasts,positive
It's really good I've got premium but I need to use the genre feature in the liked songs. My genre sorting feature does not work for Android Google Pixel and I would like it to be fixed please and thank you thanks,negative
"Two major things. The premium app is supposed allow for music offline via downloaded music. Yet the app is almost unusable when offline as things still seem to require the internet to function. Also, the play completely disappears now. Why?",negative
Last update mess up the play now control bar,negative
Much greater music selection and control compared to other music streaming services.,positive
"Spotify has been so buggy lately - it keeps pausing/stopping by itself - at the same time, the actual pause button doesn't work when you want to pause/stop your tracks (I've had to turn my phone off to stop my music). I've tried clearing my cache, restarting my phone and uninstalling then re-installing the app. Please fix :-)",negative
This is amazing. I really like itðŸ’œðŸ’œ #spotifyðŸ’œðŸ’œ,positive
Thank You Spotify Music,positive
App crashes many times while playing,negative
It's very easy to use and nice music listening application.It recommends me nice music as per my interest.It is a very nice platform.,positive
"Music, music and more music. Access possibly the most complete library of recordings known to mankind, with Spotify.",positive
Love it!I love being able to make my own playlists!,positive
"Well I gave it a four star rating because when I play a song it just keeps on playing the song in my playlist and I can remove the song when I fully exit the app,so it's pretty annoying. Other than that,I really like everything else just besides the annoying part.so it's a pretty good app to me",positive
"Full of ads, after every couple of songs",negative
Spotify is so great to the extent that I dont know how I would listen to music without it,positive
"At for the first about 2 weeks it was completely fine but after that just constant crashing, pausing, And deleting and re-downloading I would like to listen to a song and it randomly just put me on a song I have never heard or put on my play list. Another thing after one song on my Playlist it goes to the same one Spotify now sucks in my opinion and would like all of these issues fixed thank you and have a nice day. ðŸ˜…",positive
"Excellent application for listening to the music of our choice ! I haven't seen such a large collection elsewhere . Dr.T N . Kumar ., Bengaluru ,South India .",positive
Phone app gets confused when you have a tv with spotify and the shows often won't play on the TV.,negative
"Last few months, during every song 1 - 4+ times, dead air for a second or more! So annoying and frustrating. I can't listen anymore! Have high speed internet and no other apps or devices do this! And it's at several different places, house, cottage, cars, etc. It's Spotify for sure, as other music apps having no issues. Need it fixed, or need to delete.",negative
I have used Spotify for years. I know the podcast feature is fairly new. Please fix the video feature on JRE.,negative
Rubbish I don't know if it updated or something but you can't play a specific song anymore,negative
I'm really really irritated that you only get six skips in your liked list. What if I'm not in the mood to listen to a song that I like? At LEAST give us unlimited skips in our own Playlists. Please. I know I'm not the only one frustrated.,negative
Spotify plays almost everything I can remember and that's enough,positive
I've installed this app once again but it's not opening even keeping it on for hrs.....,negative
"Best App as it , Provides a wide range of Songs , BGMs and Also supported Background Music , But it will Be better if we can Clip from these songs And listen those clips",positive
"Spotify was a solid app until the last few builds. Now, it crashes randomly, doesn't display player controls if I have it running in the background and call it up again, skips ahead a few seconds if I try to minimize it, and will start playing in my car even if I don't have the app open. I've had to force stop the app and clear the cache way too often. When it works, it works well, but that's becoming more the exception than the rule",negative
Really good. Music is brilliant. Only thing is that on some devices (like my phone) does not let things loop.,positive
I wish the equaliser settings were available on android,negative
its very helpful to find good music,positive
Enjoy it,positive
There making the songs worst by removing cuss words but other than that it's a five star â­,negative
Too many ads. There is one ad per song when it used to be just 4 songs per ad.,negative
I love this app and this app will be helpful for k-pop Stan's cause when a new song idols made and after some sec we can find it in Spotify....but sometimes for the ads I get distracted by the song so that's a only trouble for me nothing more I just love this appâœ¨ðŸ’œ,positive
Don't like ads,negative
Great selection but a larger one would be nice. Puts songs that I like together very well!,positive
"hell nah this app actually got mad worseðŸ’€ i was just gonna check out how its doing then it just randomly logs me out of my account and i can't even get back into it anymoreâœ‹ but yeah this app still won't let me listen to my favourite songs unless if i put them in a playlist and shuffle it ðŸ™ƒ i highly recommend using other music apps and not this tbh, uninstalled",negative

Best music app out. Way better than Apple music,positive
Mind blowing app my all favouite song available in this app,positive
Spotify sucks compared to literally every one of its competitors.,negative
"Great app. Easy to use, clear musics. I love, love it.",positive
Really good except commercial to many of them,positive
The app provides access to various smaller artists and provides them a platform to be heard,positive
"A good app with one annoying element - on an album, individual track versions are frequently different to the original album. Suspect this is to save storage space by keeping only one version of each song. This doesn't acknowledge though the work that typically goes into crafting an album and it contents by the artists.",negative
Very good app but so many ads,positive
Listen to Spotify all the time everyday,positive
"Very nice app , but too much ads",negative
Adds more adds can't choose can't skip. But still good app. Need to get premium,positive
The nut was pretty good,positive
The player really sucks. It's missing basic features and functionality. The content is A+,negative
Spotify is a great app.,positive
Spotify is one of the best choices for music that I can think of. I had premium for a year and that was really great cause I was able to make-up some fantastic playlists. And they don't erase them when you go back to free.,positive
"Spotify was great until all of a sudden I logged out for 1 quick second and now I can't load into the app and I'm stuck in the loading screen with the logo for the past 3 days, it'd be 5 stars if this was fixed.",negative
Tooo much ads! I bet if this app can play 5 songs continuously (WITHOUT ADS).ðŸ˜‘,negative
"Occasionally the podcast stop playing in the middle and exit, this happens a couple times during one episode. Add it own songs to my playlist which i dislike. Wish it was better idk what else to use and i can't update for new version because there's no update",negative
It's the perfect app for listening to music,positive
New to Spotify and I have to say so far I have no issues. ðŸ‘ðŸ»,positive
This application is good application,positive

"what the hell?? everything was okay untill the new update. this app is impossible to use rn, the songs are playing on shuffle all the time and now they shown like a sentence or something please fix this :(",negative
I like the app but I don't get why you have to pay to skip songs it makes no sense.,negative
Great app you have made I have a request that you remove prime user in Spotify Or gave us free,positive
"the comparison I've inadvertently done between Spotify & Tidal has come to an unexpected clear winner. Tidal may sound slighty better, but Spotify has more of the music I love, and even if only free, I've noticed Spotify having more of what I love than Tidal's more limited lossless audio selection, which disappointed me with it's lack of my favorites this Christmas.",negative
"Signed up for premium, but it didn't take. Might have been my mistake. Great sound, great library to choose songs from!",positive
"I love this app. That is all I can think of. It is better than most of the music apps I use, and I can listen to all my favorite songs. 10 out of 10",positive

Works great I even play music off line,positive
The login experience of the app on Android is very poor. I have been trying to log in to the app since the last 30 minutes. It keeps getting times out. Faced the same issue last time and ended up creating a mew account,negative
Love Spotify but i wish it played the song and not songs mixed together,negative
I personally think spotify as a company is shady and I don't recommend supporting them. The app itself works fine and is everything you expect,negative
The whole thing which you have to pay for premium and not get advertising is great but for one problem. Everytime you want to listen to a podcast you get advertising please fix this problem The music you get no advertising with premium,negative
"Been a good time using spotify for the most part. I enjoy the easy access and mobility of all features available paying, because without it, your annoyed. Otherwise yeah, good times wah. See how it goes been using for a year or so, so at like 12$ cad good to roll i guess, cause how else is their music these days unless your buying this subscription stuff?",positive
The app is amazing. It is great for listening to music. 5 of 5 stars for my review.,positive

Problem since last update. I can't access the 'now playing' and bar. I have been unable to turn off the music. Worked perfectly until now. I have done a clean uninstall / install but no change. I am gutted! I'm a premium subscriber. â˜¹ï¸Any ideas?,negative
A good app. Only that I don't know how to download audio music on this app. Can you get me through it?,positive
Spotify is awesome and not that hard but feels like it takes years to download an update. RECOMMENDED!,negative
Very awesome app very easy to use,positive
"Recent updates have made the list of liked songs to disappear. New songs can't be visibly added to the list. If I go under an individual song I can see that it is liked, yet no songs appear in the playlist. It is possible to activate the list through Google Assistant. Sometimes when you press play on a podcast, nothing happens, and then you ha e to restart the app to get it to work. Edit: pressing play on a new podcast no longer works at all.",negative
It's good if your kid can't play bad music the parent can let them only,positive

Super music  app,positive
It's really good for listening to music and I haven't dealt with problems yet at all which I can't say for all but if you just feel like listening to music Spotify is a good resource,positive
Don't change a running system! Since the latest update the app is totally broken. Fix it! PS: Test your stuff before release.,negative
Love listening to podcasts!!!,positive
This app randomly keeps going offline and takes ages to get online. Thats annoying since I've definitely got a connection.,negative
Bro I hate the fact I can't preview sings while adding song to my playlist it's stupid. I get trying to make money but at least make it so we can play a sing whenever we want yall have over a billion downloads ur making enough money give some of us broke people some premium features. Also the amount or ads is stupid and the 30 min of ad free listening is bs two 3 min songs ain't 30 min,negative
Spotify continues to surprise me with the depth of music available - always uplifts my day!,positive
I was enjoying it until I was recently log out and had to lose all my music I had downloaded. This pissed me off.,negative

Spotify is way better than Pandora,positive
Good selection of music easy to navigate,positive
The bestest app for songs ever ðŸ¤ª,positive
Great,positive
This app is great. On the pc app you can skip songs unlimitedly. You can listen to as much music as you want each month/week for free with minimal ads.,positive
I love Spotify but lately there have been a lot of bugs where Spotify will shut down out of no where and just stop playing. Also sometimes the play button at the bottom disappears so you can't pause. I would give it 5 stars before all of this started happening.,negative
Hasn't worked on my phone since the last update. Doesn't recognize any of my playlists or saved podcasts. Will open the home screen but when I select something to listen to I just a blank screen with a green spinning wheel. Used to work great before Feb 8.,negative

"Hi, spotify is awesome but don't know my spotify is not opening. I tried opening it but it closses please do something. Other wise the app is very very cool and has a large amount of songs. And if you could do something here is my username : Reck J",positive
"A music streamer which became a manipulator, hosting shows with life threatening misinformation. Google, please don't remove my review because i will contact the media.",negative
"Man. This used to be my most used app. I've had premium for years but the past couple months have been increasingly aggravating. First the pause button wouldn't work as expected. Then it would show the wrong song or podcast playing. Now it randomly stops playing and every couple minutes the now playing bar disappears and the whole app has to be restarted. I've done so much troubleshooting, changing settings, reinstalling, nothing makes it better. It is unusable for me currently. Shame.",negative
"After last Update the music player didn't work well, after this update the app keeps crashing irregulary every few minutes. Really, really anoying and specially for a huge company like Spotify an embarrassing bad software quality for quite a while now.",negative
"The app used to be great but recent updates have caused issues with connectivity and playback buttons dissappearing! I now have to close the app to stop music. Wonderful. Surprising though, that there are no issues with billing whatsoever!",negative
"Spotify is great, any music you enjoy can be found here. I enjoy it very much!",positive
I use this like for 3 years no problem it's super fun and cool experience and now the update come my Spotify keep shutting down every time i play i hope you make up for this .. now I'm using your Spotify lite because of that reason i try everything possible to fix but nothing happen,negative

Good music selection,positive
Found many of the songs I like but there are still some songs and artists I can't find,positive
Filtering of podcasts and sorting seem to be lumped together making finding unplanned episodes in date order difficult and having to redo it every time I open app,negative
It won't even play songs on my play list ðŸ˜¤,negative
I love Spotify this has my fav songs expect one also the ads it ruins the moment but if u get premium there will be no ads but this is a fav app I will always listen to songs everydayðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¼,positive
Spotify admits that their app is no longer fit for Samsung devices but are in no hurry to refund premium users. What a disgrace. Fix your app.,negative
It is a good music ap,positive
I enjoy finding music of all kind an especially fr the pass I like the search always helps me with what I'm looking for correctly,positive

A lot of music to listen and well listed to,positive
It has good audio quality and features but Spotify kept turning on when I didn't want it to and play music. I was gaming with my friend and the app started playing music 7 times by its self.,negative
The app is easy to use and produces good sound quality when subscribed to premium. The downside is you have a lot of missing songs ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸,positive
Love that you can save songs and play them when you go to the off grid house for the weekend!,positive

"I love spotify long time user of the premium until recently I had to drop my subscription due to lack of income. Now it won't let me listen even without premium it says ""Your payment failed"" can't even play my songs anymore...",negative
Downloaded this to listen to podcasts. There is a glitch problem where when im listening to an episode it will suddenly change to a different one. Very annoying.,negative
Waste of time there no song if you want to listen a song then search its singer's name that is always worst app for ever,negative
They had a bug and they fixed it very quickly after I reported it I love this app I would die for it,positive
It is not opening now....I m facing trouble a lot...very bad app....,negative
Currently the play bar is disappearing from the bottom of the app constantly. Extremely frustrating and yet marked as resolved according to their website. Will be leaving 1 star review until this is fixed properly because it's a core feature that should never be broken (for an extended period of time at that) in a music app.,negative
"They've increased the ads and seem to be phasing out the ""watch this short video and get 30 minutes of ad free listening"". You have to listen to 4-5 short ads before a Playlist will start and they've put ads in the beginning, middle and end of podcasts. Honestly this app is now more trouble than its worth.",negative
Really great way to enjoy music,positive
"The app is full of bugs, it sacrifices basic features in favor of serving you another ad. But the main issue is the fact that podcasts with misinformation are not removed from the platform.",negative
Why i rate it a 1 IT WONT LET ME CHANGE THE DAM SONG ALL I WANTED TO HEAR WAS GANGSTA PARADISE BUT NO INSTED SOMETHING RANDOM LIKE WHAT EXCUSE ME,negative
Good for the music's and no ad,positive

I love Spotify ,positive
I haven't found a music app I enjoy more.,negative
"I've always liked spotify and used it heavily, but now they're giving a platform to dangerous disinformation through the Joe Rogan podcast, I can't support them. If you can, please consider using a more responsible music service. Also, spotify connect is just awful, and makes the app really annoying to use because you can't turn it off.",negative
I love this app and I'm freaking out because I accidentally logged myself out of my account and when I went back on the app it just have spotify symbol in middle of screen and doesn't do anything... Ive uninstalledthe app 2 times and still nothing..,negative
"It's good but, when i played a song it keeps on changing/shuffling i cant even play my fave song! What if the other doesnt like the other song?! i keep on playing my fave song but it keeps on SHUFFLING like what the, last time when i dowloaded this to my ipad it's not even like that when i played my fave song it's not changing. I know your app is full of music but it's too restrictring, what kind of update is that soptify?! I 'm so disapointed i did everything!",negative
Hoping your 2022 resolutions include getting Spotify to work again. I am constantly getting the no internet connection error but have internet to work remotely at home. There is definitely a problem with the app. Judging by the comments there is definitely a problem on your side.,negative
"I like it so much because we can listen songs by different languages and also we can listen podcast by different native speakers by Live performance. So, Thanks a Lot to Spotify ðŸ‘",positive
"Wow, love story's FABULOUS. Thank you looking forward other story's.",positive
Love the freedom of primer but I still get adverts.,positive
"Please add a way to stop telling me to connect to a device most times when I open the app. If I want to connect to a device, I'll do so. Also, please have a dedicated portion of the home screen for new music for artists I listen to/recommend. Tired of having to just see if it's there or not and then having to search out music on my own.",negative
this app is so ridiculously stupid as hell it has every song you can imagine but why the hell does it play random songs i didnt even put in my playlist its so stupid and plus theres limited skips and you can only shuffle on moblie???? what the hell its so garbage and stupid it annoys me how this is the only music app other soundcloud which is horrible. i really hate this garbage app that is so half assed,negative

Can no longer pause songs. What happened to this functionality?,negative
Awesome reference to my favorite tunes,positive
Love it because lots of good artists to choose from,positive
"The app is ok but its not very helpful for long distance couples. You can make a family or duo account but you all have to live at the same address, what about people that want to share an account but are 4000 miles apart and need something to bring them closer together, we thought Spotify would do this for us but let us down badly ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­",negative

I only got to listen one day. But I think it's pretty cool.,positive
Literally the only music app I can use all other ones confuse me ðŸ’€,negative
"The ads have gotten completely unbearable, I'll get four or five in a row before my music is played. It also keeps recommending me and even playing songs from artists I've blocked, which is a big problem because things I have blocked trigger panic attacks. I'm completely done with this garbage, been screwd over too many times by this lousy app.",negative
They need to stop the app from automatically playing when i get in the car. I've been waiting years for the fix. (I've tried all the normal settings they claim work - but don't),negative
I listen music from this app i heard many song i have giving 5 star to spotify,positive
Won't display the song and doesn't give me the option to change song since this latest update....all my liked trackes disappeared all but a handful...it lags and Al lot of my saved music never appears to be there when I have no service...I feel like this app has become worse over the years. I've tried redownloading it and it hasn't helped the situation,negative
Used to work flawlessly. Under android 12 the problems are too numerous to mention.,negative
The music I've liked over my lifetime all in one place! Great App!!!,positive
"Please fix the dozens of bugs. Shocking experience. Now playing bar doesn't appear, podcasts won't play despite being fine on desktop. Had to uninstall and redownload, lost all my downloaded songs and files. I live in a bad signal area so rely on downloads when not on WiFi. For a market leader it's absolutely ridiculous.",negative
"It plays random songs that aren't on my Playlist when I try to listen to songs on my Playlist, the 6 skips per hour thing is completely bogus, and it just about forces you to buy their premium, just to listen to the music you want to listen to.",negative
Nice songs on the play listðŸ™‚ðŸ‘,positive
Spotify is the best music website in the world. Minimal adds with the free service and pretty much any song you can think of. I would recommend spotify to all of my friends and family,positive
Please if you would provide us with a video player It would be fantastic,positive
"Wow the best app ,so far so good for music lovers guys ,can,t complain .thumps up",positive
"Worst customer service, I'm having issues where the app won't play the samples of music before deciding to add to playlist, get on the service chat, first over an hour and I guess they forgot about me, get om 2nd time with new person, wait 30 min even though they said they were looking into it, cam back and asked what the issue was, what were you doing for half an hour then tell basically turn it on and off, shockingly that didn't work...",negative
Really enjoy the app listening to songs I haven't heard in a long time. Not just greatest hits but B side songs as well. Glad I found you,positive
"Great idea for music playlists and songs, but I listen to more ads then music. I play 1 song and then get 7 ads back to back that are 30 seconds a piece.",negative
I need to get my old gmail account I don't have the account on my phone I don't have any of the phone number or the old account on any of my devices I've been acting scammed and I'm trying to recover and old account,negative

Its reallly good for music <3,positive
"I love using Spotify, been using this on a lot of my devices. The problem is, after the update, my spotify playback notification is looking very weird. The artist's album picture that I'm listening to is not centered and it's too small. They no longer look nice like the previous version. Is this an error?",negative
"Only joined to listen to Joe Rogan after all the publicity.. listened to a lot of his podcasts on other platforms.. I would NEVER Listen to the ""offended artists"" who threatened to leave anyway ðŸ¤£ will give more stars if it's a reliable experience.. but the reviews don't look good ðŸ™„",negative
It's a good app if you want to listen to music and have 4 adds after every 2 songs,positive
"Excellent quality overall! I very much appreciate that a person can close the app and still have the music playing. Also, WIDE VARIETY OF GENRES! Anything you can think of!",positive
"Everything is exceptional with the app Only one thing would make it even better, a default playlist for all the downloaded songs",positive
My only complain is not being able to download a single song... Like i have to create a playlist everytime to download a song,negative
It's great to use on xbox and has a cool feature where I can turn the music high and low or have gameplay sound zero or my song zero I rarely get adds using this aswell on xbox but the only problem though is that when I use it on mobile it is stuck on shuffle and way too many adds but other than that it's perfect ðŸ‘,positive
Honestly this is the best app for music and podcasts because there is way more podcasts and music and it doesn't cost you anything unless you want to pay only thing different is when you pay for subscription your paying for changing the songs that you like but it's not bad i only pay because I want too otherwise you don't have to pay anything for it and they don't have many ads even if you don't have premium there is hardly any ads and they even have ads if you watch to take time from ads,positive
"I had signed up for family plan but whenever my mom is using it and so am I , we struggle because it won't let her have her music at home and mine on my drive. Curious why I pay for family If we can't use it at the same time. I'll probably switch to basic cause I'm pretty sure she got her own plan anyway",negative

Very nice for music experience.,positive
Good music that I like and love,positive
"Spotify has been working hard to make free into the absolute minimum viable product. It's constantly playing ads, and songs on custom playlists barely ever get played in favour of whatever Spotify would rather play for you. Not worth the trouble unless you pay.",negative
Best music app with killer play list.,positive
"Its really bad now, every time try to pay it always reconet over and over. Enough with spotify.",negative

Currently running into a bug when connecting to anything Bluetooth or via my car w/Android Auto. Heavy issues playing music. Ending up needing to restart my phone multiple times to fix its issue. No currently playing bar showing up in the app or externally.,negative
It's just the Best Music App Ever ðŸ˜Ž,positive
This app is unbelievably buggy at the moment. Constantly pausing tracks at random and then the play bar vanishes - this means that if it's playing the only way to stop a track is close the app down. The only fix I've found is to restart my phone every time it happens. This fixes it for a short time then the bugs come creeping back.,negative
Have had to redownload delete download delete download multiple times because the app is glitching and not showing me what song is playing or giving me the option to skip forward or backwards and I pay for premium really pissing me off,negative
Really good music and top quality sound,positive
I have been a premium user of Spotify for more than a year Due to the best experience Ive had I recommend this app Thank you for the best service Spotify,positive

"The app now is really money-driven, I've been using the app for years but it recently got so much worse. Now I can't even listen to snippet of a song before adding it to my playlist, the adds sucks and just simply annoying. They can't add anymore features so now they restrict us from enjoying the basic features like skipping songs.",negative
I love it. Now maybe it's my phone. But the damn thing can't seem to keep playing while I'm using maps. Maybe it's trying to save memory? Either way Joe Rogan is my man for that new info and he backs it!,negative

This is the best app. I use it to listen to music and podcasts. User friendly layout and even personalized albums based on the genre you listen to.,positive
"Love the app and the ease, but the thing that lets it down most is the integration with Google Assisstant. Asking it to play one track and you get a completely different one. I don't know which end has the issue but it definitely causes a lot of headaches.",positive
Love the variety of music. I have my calming piano music to put me to sleep at night which is so much better then the radio as no ads. I change my play list off and on my with my moods.

"I don't know why would anyone without a subscription would download the version for mobile. It's absolutely fill to the brim with ads, it's impossible to use playlists and it feels literally designed to NOT be used without a subscription. The aggressive marketing is the core driven of the mobile version and a slap to the face for any user. This is one of the many good reasons that keep me from buying a subscription or supporting Spotify in any way. Don't install it.",negative
Good app,positive
Luv it ,positive
The only reason this app is superior is the fact that has so many artists and podcast besides that it is so irritating to be listening to the liked songs that you have on your list and then catch an ad listen to two songs and then catch another add if not one song and another ad your skips don't even replenish after the hour you can time it yourself if you'd like to try last thing I have to complain about though is the fact that continues to play the same songs even though they're the most skip,negative
Seriously wow!! From yesterday i installed many music apps but none were good and finally i got this lovely app... Thankyou so much Spotify!!!,positive
"For the past months, the app has problems loading my Playlists and is really annoying. And sometimes when I search for music it says there's no internet connection and doesn't find anything. Even if my connection is 100% strong. Or sometimes I press play and it displays message ""please connect a device"" and it refuses to play the song. If the app is not going to be fixed soon, you'll lose subscribers. Please do smth. Thank you.",negative

How many ads,negative
Please ignore previous negative rating. This app is super great. I give it five stars+,positive
The recent updates were horrible. You wanna hear the song you want? Well... YOU CAN'T! There will be a shuffled playlist so you wouldn't hear the music you want. Oh but you can skip it right? Well if your lucky to skip less than 6 in order to get the song you wanted to hear. But let's just say you couldn't find the song you wanted to hear and you skip more than 6. Sorry but it couldn't let you skip anymore so you have to WAIT FOR A HOUR to get 6 more skips. Hope you remove your dumb skip limit.,negative
"I don't know what changed with updates, but my spotify is opening too slowly. That loading bar appears and force me to turn off my internet and re open it. It is only happening when starting the app. It is definitely some kind of bug. Because I have used this app for 2 years at least. There was never a problem like that. Edit: I took back one star.",negative
"Give Spotify low rating one star for not responding to our reports and complaints. As a customer, state what you have experienced while trying to play the song MONEY by LISA",negative
It doesn't help put my newborn to sleep that the commercials are twice as loud as the calming music that was playing seconds earlier,negative

It's pretty cool with the new enhance feature but you really gotta work on the suggestions. I remove the same recommended songs and it keeps putting them back on there. It's annoying,negative
"Excellent selection and useful ""song radio"" feature. 5/5 would buy again.",positive
well its pretty good app but the main problem to earn money they have launched their premium plans and we are unable to play songs of our choice shuffle is alright but still wish they could do something about it otherwise its pretty decent app that provides a large variety of music,positive
"Hated the songs that are recommended, even the skips are limited. You are forcing us to listening to the songs that we are not willing to.",negative
"Awesome selection and matching the types of music and artist, definitely my go-to for music. Must have for the music aficionados.",positive
Great for listening and music discovery & promoting your own music.,positive
"I would rate this app 5 stars, the quality is perfect I've always wanted a music app like this. The only problem is it has ads after each song...that has to be improved! Its an really amazing app for partying and group study. I will suggest you to download this amazing app!!!!!!!!!!!",positive
L app,positive
"Not a frequent user of Spotify. Have dipped in and out in the past. But will stick around for good. Thanks for inviting me to return, Spotify. Looking forward to explore the variety of musical choices. They say 'variety is the spice of life' and if 'music be the food of love play on'.",positive
Cool app. And with the latest update I can add some good 70s folk rock into my mix without having to worry about pressing the skip button every time Joni Mitchell starts caterwauling about clouds or SCIENCE!â„¢ or some such nonsense.,positive
This Spotify is my stress buster but more advertisement are coming I'm not like thatðŸ‘Ž,negative
Great selections and app is user friendly.,positive
Excellent,positive
Wonderful and easy to use music app,positive
The app is good because you can turn off you phone,positive
"Simple to use, happy I added this happy!",positive
"Constantly stopped playing randomly or plays but shows on the app that it isn't playing causing me not to ve able to pause or fast fwd, etc...",negative
It's actually good if you are a premium user,positive
I can't even listen to my favourite songs in peace. There are too much ads. Downloaded it to listen to music and not some random people telling us forcefully that premium is better. Gonna switch it to some other apps. Disappointed with this app.,negative
"Okay the Ads are justified but please do no put spooky sounds and advertisements! We will get premium as and when we'll be able to afford it! I was listening to music and in the middle there was an add for -""I can hear you! "" It scared the hell out of me! Please better advertisement will be appreciated by the non- premiere members !",negative
I love it real simplicity,positive
"Normally a good app, but the bug where Spotify randomly closes itself is back. Especially once you lock the screen",negative
It is very interesting music play app,positive
Very good quality sound nicely to use,positive
Superbbb app to use while writing records....,negative
I can't even hear the music I want now I can't even skip the songs I don't want to hear this is good only fo the first day,positive
"If you have a free account don't even bother downloading the app. You can't choose what songs you want to play, you can only shuffle. On top of this, the app forces you to listen to ""suggested songs"" and will not allow you to continue to listen to the music actually in your playlist. A free account works perfectly on the web browser, but the app is actual garbage.",negative
"ok, Spotify premium is awesome but- when you get off of premium you cant even choose your own songs to listen to. you have to listen to it on *shuffle.* dumb reason to get mad but this pissed me right off. what the hell? lemme choose what song *i* wanna listen to. update : now it keeps crashing and im on premium.",negative
"For a music streaming service, they really want to sell podcasts. Super annoying and no way to turn them off.",negative
I have two stars because when i quit the app with songs the songs stop and when i am replay the song again it stops so fix it before 2 week or else you will 0 or 1 star,negative
Great to listen to music,positive
Very nice music app ðŸ‘ ðŸ‘,positive
"Keeps asking for connection to the internet, even though I have all music locally and have paid account to listen to music when far from city, where internet is not available. This last update got things worse, background playback now fails when screen is off and locked. Regret on this update is here to stay :/",negative
Best app I have found in play store for music and for podcast ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€,positive
Best app for music and consumes less mobile data,negative
This is a star I gave him a lot Why can't I listen to it in Iran? Then your countries start pondering and say freedom and ...? Then we can not listen to our country?..A student ... teenager ... you do not value us listening to our favorite songs because we are from Iran... Do you think we love ourselves here?We are in pain but we do not have the right to speak ... This is just music ....Do you really take this from us?,negative
I can't play what I want to hear on my playlist.,negative
Phone gets disconnected from my chromecast during playing but continues on chromecast or app stops casting.,negative
I just love the app and I am using it since long,positive

Love the variety of my favorite tracks,positive
Very good! Love the music!!!,positive
"I originally liked the business model. I'd rather pay for a better service and now I do. So I uninstalled Spotify for the final time. I'll enjoy my high quality lossless music elsewhere. I maintain a library of lossless music and expect the same from my apps. Amazon and apple deliver. So goodbye forever Spotify, you can suck it.",negative
Love it great music app,positive
Bacana,positive
Please focus on music not add,negative
An advertisement app with some songs in it. Hehehe!,negative

How to seek forword and shuffle? Many other problem with user experience.,negative
I like how you can select singers & groups ahead of time. Also the app puts together a daily mix based on your listening choices.,positive
Omg I love this app is much,positive
I've never had any issues with spotify!,positive
It's the best music browser,positive
"Somewhat a good app. It's a paid service so I expect premium service. I download podcasts for OFFLINE USE and the app is barely useable offline. All your downloaded podcasts can only be accessed while connected to the servers DESPITE BEING DOWNLOAD. ""Oh, just go into offline mode"" you might think. HORRIBLE IDEA! Offline mode is a suicide switch for this app. Switching to offline mode causes the app to delete a bunch of downloaded content. I pay for this stupid service.",negative
"Overall...Meh. Selection and audio quality is pretty good but the navigation is horrible. Same goes for Android Auto version. Way too many taps to get to common areas. Also, it's integration with Google speakers is less than desirable.",negative
"Least it let's me download the songs Pandora won't even though they have it. Though it doesn't have every song i wanted, can't be helped I guess",negative
My experience with the Spotify was very good,positive
"Love Spotify. Gives ads, you can pay for Spotify premium tho, which is great for listening offline.",positive
With Spotify it's a good site This site is easy to get all the best songs and documentr,positive
"Been using for 6 years+, never fails to disappoint me.",positive
"What is happening with the crashes and bugs Spotify. Please resolve. Long time premium subscriber here, I will cancel premium if this continues and resort to streamed radio as the constant disruptions are frustrating",negative
It's just so great ðŸ‘ the amount of wonderful types of music ðŸŽ¶ at your fingertips and listening to the immaculate playback each time you go into a different genre without any problems or hassle at all. Spotify is 100% for me!!,positive
Simply the best music and podcast streaming app.,positive
"Recent update broke everything. Songs randomly stop, the play bar disappears. It's been a week and no fix, just revert it ffs",negative
"The app was good so far. But suddenly after the last update, the app keeps crashing whenever I'm trying to play anything making both the app and my subscription useless.",negative
It good ,positive
"The app is great, and I love spotify, but it doesn't let me open podcasts when I'm offline even if I've downloaded said potcasts. This is really annoying, especially for long car rides or when my internet is down for a while. Please fix this.",negative
"Terrible really. Slow to load menus, searches, library. Sometimes it wont even load my saved songs for minutes forcing me to restart the app. Even worse if it's in offline mode. Often just stops playing randomly and has to be reset to work again. Terrible app",negative
Have no pop up for current music playing and spofity keeps stopping music out of nowhere. Please update,negative
It's great to be able to listen to my favourites.,positive
Recent update- my phone no longer auto populates track info to my stereo in my truck. Before if it did this i could still controll the music ( skip pause etc) now i have zero controll. Only way to regain controll is to restart phone. FIX THIS PLEASE! ONE PLUS 8 JVC KWV840BT,negative
Lot less ads than the other companies,negative
Was enjoying this app but since it updated carnt skip song and can no longer choose the track i want to listen to . Before update would of been 5 stars didnt have playlists interupted by adverts now after every song,negative

Love the Music & it's so clear! Music to sooth the savage beast!!,positive
It's a good streaming app u just gatta go to premium for the real fun,positive
Excellent app. Live Spotify!!,positive
Spotify sucks I only have 6 skips and when I go on my PLAYLIST to play music IT DOESN'T EVEN PLAY THE FULL THING I SHOULD HAVE INFINITY SKIPS FREAKING SUCH A BAD APP TELL ME WHEN YOU FIX THIS,negative

I cant even play the songs in my playlist,negative
"Before the update it was amazing. Unlimited skips, no ads, high quality sound etc. But now I hate it so much. Spotify if you see this please change this app into like before the update. First of all, when I wanted to listen to a song, that unskippable 15 seconds ad pops up. I had to close the app and reopen it. Its so annoying! Second of all, why cant I pick a specific song i wanted to? Its so hard to use! Please Spotify reply me if you saw this!!!",negative
"I could not live without Spotify. It's the best medicine ever. Through your own individual choose of music, Spotify will set up playlists for songs of the genre you like, which helps you connect with old and new music. Spotify has saved me in my darkest of places in the corners of my mind. It's fantastic value for money and it helps the environment by not buying CDs etc. Well done Spotify. You're here with now and you'll be there at the end. There's so much talent around eg Thomas Rhett... xxx",positive
This makes you feel better when you are not feeling ok means when you are sad it can easily make you happy by songs. There are also sad songs but it is very satisfying app. I like it very much. After downloading this app you will be very happy. Thanks for makin this app.,positive
"Used to be a good app. Now you can't even listen to your own playlist in the order that you want to, it just plays whatever is in your playlist randomly. Unless you buy premium. Not to mention there are a lot of artists and songs that aren't even on here (or blocked by premium) you're better off just utilizing the Watch Later section on YouTube to listen to music. Atleast they have more options and you can listen in the order you want to.",negative
A lot of bugs Sometimes it's incredibly slow This past days the song being played does not appear at the bottom like it usually does. I have to force stop the app and open it again for it to start working properly,negative
All good,positive
"I thoroughly enjoy Spotify. I listen to music, podcasts, meditations you name it. It's definitely one of my best apps right after my Bible app.",positive
"Hmm,The app is just great. But why 3 stars? The reason being, ads after every 2 songs. That's very annoying and forces to download any other app. ðŸ˜’",negative
"Listen to music on this app almost all day, every day. Super affordable and has a very wide variety of music available.",positive
This is the worse app when it comes to dealing with users complain and issues ... You can't do anything if you came through an issue... They don't even respond to anyone complains and reports ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,negative
Poor service and inconsistent,negative
"Great music that you can't find on Pandora. Music is clear and good quality for the speakers I am listening through, whether it be my car or headphones, great quality.",positive
It's a great app...easily one of my favourite music apps but it's got some bugs...sometimes ads appear and the dismiss button doesn't work and you have to restart the app and sometimes it consumes a huge load of data and memory than usual...overall it's an awesome app .... would recommend to everyone....!!,positive
Good ,positive
"Always been very pleased with Spotify but the latest app version is a complete disaster - no play bar, stops playing after 10 mins etc. etc",negative
It's great app with a variety of playlists,positive
Such a great app for wonderful music,positive
"It's all good but , when we watch ads it say say that "" You will get 30 min of uninterrupted music "" but after 4-5 min the ad will start again ..... Fix this problem as soon as possible Otherwise All thing is good",negative
"This app has remixes from Music Artist that I've been listening to for over a couple of decades now that I didn't even know existed when it came to particular songs, overall, this app is really good.",positive
Among us. Nah but fr it's pretty good just annoying to use on mobile if you don't have Spotify premium.,negative
It says no inernet connection but i have full internet connection,negative
"Nothing better than Spotify premium, after being a long-term subscriber, i got a hulu account free, and then later on i won a free google nest device. Love it! I've found every song I've ever tried to search. Premium is worth it! You can even download all ur music and listen to it on airplane mode! â¤â¤â¤",positive
You had an option to listen to the part of the song before adding to playlist which has been removed. Bring it back.,negative
It's wonderful app it will provide variety of musics as per ur moods ðŸ˜€ðŸ’œ,positive
"An amazing app since the day I caved in and got it years ago. Also an open platform for people to share whatever ideas, religions, opinions, beliefs, etc - that they want. A platform that doesn't censor freedom of speech. Hooray!",positive
Spotify is a good app for music lover i love this app Nice app good,positive
"You love music and hate ads I Highley recommend. Your music all time, 24/7 but need to pay for it and well worth it too two ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ up.",positive
This app is ok for a kid.. I have no options for picking an alarm song.. Good luck I thought to find any thing on here that I like.. and leave it to the smart net.. tapping a song to try and the thing doesn't work as expected.. the covers do not match the music .. this is with all of them to.. no matter which song I pick it doesn't match up with the music and album cover pic.. What am I complaining about my sister wouldstick records back in the jackets all mixed up to.. just like here.. ty.,negative
"All OK with app , lost some stuff when changed phone though for some reason ðŸ¤”",negative
Their online website is full of scammers. They were asking me for my credit card information. I think spotify needs to fix their system,negative
This is the best P2P engine I have found and it's a great music and podcast player,positive

Getting sick of Spotify and I've been premium for years. But will disconnect completely if app not working properly. Can't play intermittent music without have to switch off and restart the phone constantly. I'm sick of it ðŸ˜’.,negative
Nice song app,positive
To Spotify Incredible Music's you've got there man now though!!,positive
It has some nuisances but it's alright,positive
"I was never into the streaming thing! Give me a cd and I'm happy! But cars are changing with no cd players in then. Spotify, at first, was a gift and it is great! You can find more music than you can even remember! It has turned me on to bands I've never heard of and never would have found them had it not been foe Spotify!",positive
"The best, any music any style you'll find it here",positive
It constantly opens a banner with last song played even though I haven't opened the app in weeks. This is so irritating. I've searched Google for answers turned off anything in administration that looks remotely to stop it and it just keeps popping up. Guess I'll just uninstall it way to pushy Spotify.,negative
All the free music and shows you could possibly want and more. Creations abound!,positive
The genre selection does not work properly.,negative
"I detest this app. It never works properly, I can't cast to Chromecast devices reliably, it auto plays randomly on other devices. I'm so close to just deleting the app and going with another service.",negative
It is becoming hard with every update to listen to songs..i used to love this app but now they are making it really difficult for regular people to listen to songs. What is the point of updating the app in the first place,negative
Love this app man. Van Halen fan since 1980 when I was 12 and fir life bud! Best collections of 80s hard rock I've seen. I'm an 80s rock guru and this app is top notch. ðŸ‘Œ,positive
Has a bunch of ads SoundCloud is better,negative
Not too many original rock but everything else is not bad,positive
I like Spotify vary much but I can't listen to playlists without not having to have it on shuffle. Can you please fix this?,positive
Marked up to 3* as getting used to the app after repetition but needs polishing and simplification. Alphabetized library favourites and similar would be helpful. It's hard to find things when not in order.,negative
I love all the songs it's great,positive
Its glitching even for the premium members Hate it,positive
Great app. Haven't had problems in years...,positive
"What's going on with this app the past few weeks?? Terrible service, the keyboard to pause, play, skip and generally control what I listen to keeps dissapearing, have to reinstall daily in order to fix.",negative
Best song app ever! Little bug that rarely happens is it will freeze and I can't skip it or change the song,positive
I like the app but while making the payment it doesn't work. Maybe this app isn't available in our country(Bhutan).,negative
Songs are great but after a while the audio started glitching. Audio sounds like a scratched record. I had to uninstall it a reinstall it for it to work right...,negative
It's a great app but you can't listen to one song and the adds are really annoying and I'm not paying for premium when I can just get a better app that doesn't have adds,negative
Uh Where's the button to play songs when adding them? Did it get removed?,negative
"Updating review: The latest update has changed Spotify from one of the most reliable apps on my device (Pixel 4A, 5G) to one of the least consistent. In about 8 years I've never had any issues with the service or app, which I see as one of my most trusted. Unfortunately the current build suffers frequent playback issues .. AUDIO ISSUES: buffering and stuttering, prioritising video over Audio (let me disable videos!). The device WiFi broadcasting frequently fails. All most recent reviews agree!",negative
I want to cancel my membership but there is no where in the app to do so,negative
"I use it daily and my daughter has has figured out she can listen to Disney music on it with the tv, Moana for hours.. Also, my dad was blown away when I told him you can listen to documentaries and podcasts. I love Spotify!",negative
This app used to be good. I used to be able to search for ONE song and get just ONE song now I have to listen to SEVERAL other songs even though I wanted just that one. I can't even put it on repeat anymore and I have to deal with song I don't even like to find the one that I do like. DO NOT RECOMMEND.,negative
"Was great, now it switches out of my Playlist and plays random songs it thinks I will like.",positive
"I really like it. It has generally all the songs I've looked into. But bugs in the app lead me to lower my rating. For example, I drive to work using this app and it just stops all the time. Great app can easily be a 5 star with a little more care.",negative
Recently spotify have been giving frequently adds in 1/2 song i don't know why are they frocing me to purchase Subcribtions please stop sending adds frequently in just 1/2 song. Or rather it was a 5 â­ by my side of rating. Thank you.,negative
"Describe my experience ? I've been able to find all the songs I selected. Great app. Jan.11/22 I thought I was a bona fide aficionado of rap circa 1995 but it seems I have alot to learn from Spotify, besides the legendary KRS-ONE, this music application is my new teacer",positive
I downloaded it for to listen BTS songs I really like this app even no ads here and there is only one problem that there is no Korean language............. And I would.

Great selections and playlists,positive
"If you EVER have an issue with spotify, ask for Medina M. to help you, they are the best and should be given a 15% raise.

I find it hard to play the music of my choice.The app is rubbish now,negative
"It's an okay app. Reason I use this is because it has the original and remixed versions of songs without having to pay for it.but here's a few things I don't like: 1: I made a Michael jackson playlist, and it added a ghostbusters song to it.. And I can't delete it. 2: When I make a playlist, I add a few songs, and want to listen to more like them. So I click similar. It either shows the same songs, or very little quantity of them. 3: When I'm listening, sometimes the song will just cut off.",negative
"love it but it keeps undownloading my playlists randomly, I am connected to wifi, it doesn't need an update and i still have 1 playlist downloaded pls help me",negative
"Too many ads. Just ridiculous. One ad= one song, again one ad= one song",negative
Its a good app its has a bit of adds bit for the ads removal u can always use premium,positive

Got the app to listen to Joni Mitchell on long car rides. Apparently some shill is better than a foll icon though. Jfc.,positive
"Still wondering why I can't see who is following my playlists. The social features in this app are lacking bad. Still wondering why Release Notes are impossible to find and new features have to be accidentally found. Other than that, Spotify is pretty dope.",negative
"I love the app, but it's VERY slow loading playlists or albums on 4G, even on high end phones. PLUS, the ability to quickly remove songs from your playlist while on the ""album art view"" is still missing. Since you have to exit that view and search the playlist from the beginning to find the song. The android app also DESPERATELY needs the iOS feature to swipe and quickly add songs to your queue",negative
I build lists of the music I love and explore new music without limits. This is my best music buy in years.,positive
"It's the tip of the iceberg, cuz I have only played a few selections of artists, either individually, or combined albums; in fact, giving me the feeling that they were all preselected for me; such soul melting melodies as moving, also, those I shared these wonderful songs with which were also greeted with rapturous approval.",positive

It just stops all the time now. There used to be a banner at the bottom of what's being played so you can rewind or fast forward and its gone now. It won't let you listen to the next episode of the podcast on several different ones. What changed? It sucks now.,negative
Works great; love the selection. Hoping they continue to stand for freedom of content,positive
The app has become really glitchy following recent updates. Playback continually drops out despite strong network signal. Playback freezes and minicontrols etc are inconsistent. Often the mini control reflects a different Playlist for example or shows nothing playing while a.playback is in progress. Used to be an easy five star but not getting value for money at the moment.,negative
I think spotify just need to hire a punjabi employee to right a perfect punjabi lyrics for punjabi songs then it will be excillent as there are many listener who wants to sing a song while listening as me ðŸ˜. I just noticed that there are many wrong lyrics over there. Overall it is good app,positive
"Just better all around compared to other popular music apps, BY FAR!!! XOXO",positive
"I keep trying to join a blend with a friend, and every time it says ""something went wrong"". We have both tried on our own devices and it says that or ""blend not found"".",negative
It's 2022 and this app cannot add an album to the queue. I have to manually add each song to it. Don't even metion playlists because I don't want to create a new one every time I want to listen something different,negative

Pls fix Spotify. Its keep on crash while i listen to songs before this are not like this.,negative

Amazing.....as long as you have premium!,positive
"The app has been fairly buggy the last few months, got worse with the last update. Enjoy the app and the music selection but my look to switch if things keep on this track.",negative
It's a wonderful app with a very good algorithm but it's full of bugs. The pause button goes to the left and the next and previous buttons stay together. Every time I have to log out to fix it. And when the buttons aren't like that the lyrics just disappear. I can't listen to the sample sometimes too. And like others said the the playing now bar don't shows the music. It's terrible!!,negative
One of the best music application I have ever had. This application have all my favorite K-pop songs specially BTS songs ðŸ’œi purple you Spotify ðŸ’œ,positive
I will continue to pay for and enjoy Spotify as long as they continue to allow artists free expression. My only complaint is that they have any censorship at all.,positive
Absolutely fine,positive

"Love this app, I've been using it for years but as of recently there's been a bug going on where whenever I open the app it doesn't let me change tracks it just is at idle for whatever reason then I close the app and open it again and it lets me use it. Sometimes when I open it it's stuck at the Spotify loading logo and I have no idea why. Please patch because then I'll change my review to a five star",negative
"Great content great features learning listening preference is very good. what else can one say. Except Android version falls on its face using ""add local files"". There is no way to specify which folder. So it adds everything. Voice messages, recorded notes. Ringtones , notifications, themes from other apps. Makes the option useless. However the PC version is well done. Maybe just a smarter team of developers. Hope the PC team will offer lessons to android team. All it needs is 1 folder.",negative
"i keep experiencing one bug or the other with this app. one day it's that half my downloaded playlist dissapears, another day I can't go online even when I'm connected to WiFi. and I always update, it just updates to a new bug. please fix up.",negative
Can you add a feature like we can use to accounts please and everything is perfect in this app but so many ads are coming I am getting disturb of those ads I can't feel the song because of these ads so can you please reduce the ads,negative
Overall it was very good but like at least in playlists make it like premium,positive
I have liked song that I play then all of the sudden in the middle of my playlist some other music comes up that I don't like at all then you try to skip bit then there is like 10 of those songs.This is not good service Spotify.,negative
"I used to really enjoy Spotify and the content of the people they put out. After pulling recent Joe Rogan episodes, I can no longer listen to Joe Rogan for not standing up and am seriously thinking about leaving the services. If I find a similar service I will leave the app. Just because someone says something regrettable or that you don't like doesn't mean they you can pull their content. Get a backbone.",negative
"I'm a Spotify fan, but the App has a huge Problem. When streaming to my Marantz AV the volume is reeeally coarse. When you want to turn the volume up by one ""step"" it sometimes just jumps like 1/3 of the max volume. That can kill your speakers (and ears) easily. This is unacceptable. And it's the same on two different Phones: Note 10 Lite and Pixel 6. Edit 04.02.22: Problem still persistent. Apparently Spotify does not care about their users migrating to Tidal. Edit 27.05.22: still persistent...",negative
LOVE THIS,positive
Best music app out there great for podcasts too,positive
Its very easy to use and love the end of the year thing,positive
"Love you so much ðŸ˜Spotify . Your meditation , soothing , relaxing and study focusing music is very very helpful for me . Thank you so much â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸",positive
"I love this app. It has been great up until about a month ago when it started randomly stopping during a song or podcast, weather it is a downloaded list or playing on wifi. Sometimes it will continue to play... reminds me of when out cds used to skip, but usually I have to close the app and start over. If this gets fixed, I would give 5 stars! I love making my own Playlists! Being able to listen to downloaded list at camp.... in the middle of nowhere. And looking up songs is so easy!",positive
Best,positive
"It sucks, I have a proper internet connection and every other app is working but Spotify says no internet connection.",negative
I've used spotify for awhile now and I really like it the only thing I've figured out recently was that you can no longer play a clip of the song while you are putting it on your playlist which allows you to hear the song before you add it. I honestly think you guys should but it back because maybe people would like to hear the song before adding it to their playlist because I sure do,negative
Extremely buggy and weird. it's ok on PC tho.,positive
There Are Tooooo Many Ads. For A Free User Not Good. My 4Â½ Hours Playlist Ends in 5 Hours Due To The Ads. By The Way Best Place For Each And Every Song.,negative
"I Will Give 3 Star On This App. Because Some Little Issues In This App. Like Ads, Network Loading, Premium Etc. I Will Request To The Owner. Please Fix The Little Problem. Bit This App Is Really Nice. And All The Songs Are Available On This App.",positive
"It's unbelievable how often this app crashes, pauses for no reason, or simply refuses to load or play anything, including downloaded songs. The queues often dont function. And I'm skeptical that ""shuffle"" truly is shuffled at all, the same songs always come up. Truly just a trash app. Spotify employees should focus more on doing their job and spend less time complaining about content.",negative
"This app gave me 30mins of ad free music and after 1 song of 2 mins it played 5 ads continuously. This app has given me 3 ads between 5 songs :/ I have had so bad experience that I am deleting my account and stuff, even after making 7 hr long Playlists I will never recommend spotify to anyone",negative
Loved it for years but recently they added a multi control feature that was in beta and all my friends an I loved it well recently it updated and now we don't use it any more because it's more complicated than it was when it was in beta I used to use it at home at party's at work now I don't use it at all I miss it :c,negative
"Awesome app, but too many ads, mostly 30 seconds and unskippable",negative
Spotify needs to do better because whenever I play my Playlist of songs I PICKED Spotify puts other songs in that I NEVER put it! I absolutely HATE that! I am deleting the app! Shame on you Spotify shame on you.,negative
I never used to litsan to music much but now i got spotfi i do all the time,positive
Worst app ever I can't even sign into this app!! It tells me again and again that the combination of my email and password is incorrect !! Worst app!!ðŸ˜¡,negative

Sometimes it is not working,negative
Philistine,positive
Great music options Prefer less ads,positive
I am really enjoy spotify app,positive
"Describing My experience with Spotify is NOT optional. As far back as I can remember I used to think to myself, ""why can't all music be free?"" I mean everyone was holding the music hostage, the record stores, the recording companies, the illuminati (probably, I mean those folks are just into everything). Finally, this Mr. Spotify comes along and does the right thing by making the music free. Just a few bucks per month and all the music is free! Way to stick it to the illuminati Mr. Spotify!",positive
"Nice app, I love the track selection even without giving instruction on what to play!",positive
I dus like it so much just one one thing is that i get adds when I listen to the music and what I dont like about Spotify is that I cant get rid of my listening history please add that u can remove ur history please it would make my experience 100 better please take my suggestion and use it I will give it 4 stars,positive
"Won't let me click on songs without a stupid ad, I tried it cause someone recommended it I used to like the app now it's just a disgrace. Hate the new way of things",negative
Well i dont have a prob is that when i try to listen to music it gives me 1 or 2 ads and then says i have 30min of no ad but only last 10min and also now it gives me 8 or 9 ads,negative
"Spotify in its original format was great, even with ads...but, then...they began gradually increasing ad breaks, limiting free functions, interfering with my personal song playlists by using my analytic info to INEXPLICABLY overreach my custom playlists by adding, altering, deleting, or ignoring my numerous attempts at reco be erinh",negative
My problem with this is that I'm paying for family spotify and I'm still getting commercials on podcasts. I pay to not have my program interrupted by some dumb commercial that I don't care about.,negative
So good app nice sound qualityðŸ’œ,positive
Best music and podcast app available!!!,positive
"Okay the quality of the songs are good but suddenly I'm not able to listen to songs, like I searched for a song and just when I tapped to play it, it showed me a playlist instead, I am not able to listen to songs without it being in a playlist, tell me why Spotify",negative
"When you pay its 5 starts easy, but if you dont then it's literally the worst app and you may aswell download soundcloud",negative
The player does bot show when the phone is locked even though sound is playing .,negative
I can't play the music that I want to listen the whole albums starts playing.. please fix that thing up,negative
you need fix crashing problems on your app to renew itself software it stop playing my favorite song it get very annoying,negative
"I love this Apps,given that I can listen to any type of music at any given time. It's fantastic!",positive
Love Spotify! I use it everyday. Weird glitch with my new phone. It stops playing when I turn my phone off and the que window gets stuck sometimes.,negative
"I wish Spotify brought back the listen button, whenever I try to add songs to playlist I can't listen to a short snippet of that song. Another things is the constant nofication of Bluetooth output. Almost everytime I open the app it ask me to allow Bluetooth when I did so. All of this and the constant ads makes me want to go to another site.",negative
Cannot use microphone to find songs constant loading not easy to find just albums when looking up artists it always gives you a playlist of greatest hits when you just want an album.,positive
Making it different from other's is Podcast.... Love the app,positive
Best music app but subscription rate is costly,negative
It's an absolute cheating against those people who don't buy Spotify Premium... Because there are 3 long nasty ads after each and every song... I'll delete my account if you don't reduce those long ads after every song...,negative
One of the best music listening app ever.,positive
"Thank you for scamming me. For the last 2 weeks I've been unable to access ""downloaded"" songs when I have no internet connection. And no, I have no intention of updating the app. If you restricted the functionality of an older version I shouldn't be paying for the full product..",negative
There appears to be more and more bugs happening every day. It's a shame the overall rating doesn't fully capture the current experience using the mobile app. Every issue I'm experiencing I can find in other users ratings.,negative
"Lots of music, yes. If you listen to one genre the same songs and or Playlists come up often, lacks that diversity.",negative
Love the playlist suggestion and also the radio playlist by artists or genre,positive
"I love listening to this app, it has all my favorite songs, totally worth it!! ðŸ§‹â¤",positive
Good,positive
I try to listen to certain music catagories on my saved music list and only half of them show up. EDM and techno genres need to be categorized a bit better.,negative
"If you want to be a free listener, then don't get it. You have limited skips and you can't pick the songs you want. I would recommend Pandora.",negative
"Cant pause a podcast on fold 3, podcasts pause until you open app and dismiss a ad when driving",negative
"App is good. However, seems a bug. Intermittent issue observed when phone tries to go on landscape mode, Spotify fails some of the time. Pkease get it checked thoroughly.",negative
"Fix the app! Its been broken for long enough. It's practically unusable. Keeps crashing, controls don't display (including not displaying song details) only way to stop a song playing is close the app. (Or wait for it to crash)",negative
"Spotify was best in the beggining, you can play any song you like and I believe to be add free, However like 1 month after download when I click a song It doesn't even even play the song I chose. I don't know if this happens with other people on Mobile however it is very annoying click a song only to hear something else.",negative
Spotify has killed support for Kenwood radios with android phones. No notice no nothing and the radios are still be sold as having Spotify functionality. Total ripoff and now a scam.,negative
Ahh. It gets so frustrating when you can't get premium and it adds songs to your playlist when you just want to listen to your dang songs,positive
My favourite player. Easy to access data from any device. Easily maintained playlists and liked song. And of course premium has greater features. Love this player.ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘Œ,positive
"Keeps bugging out, tried reinstalling several times and I know it not my phone as this is the only app I'm having issues with. If they manage to stop messing up the app with each update then I would recommend it, but I can't in the state it's in now.",negative
"You've stuffed the user experience. The ""now playing"" page is difficult to find, as is the ""Play to external device"" feature, and when in landscape mode, it says nothing is playing when it is actually playing music.",negative
You are paying for a service that keeps crashing. Used to be brilliant but ever since the beginning of 2022 it's been filled with bugs.,negative
Best music app to ever exist,positive
First the music wont show on the desktop wins app then go to browser to play was doing fine til today keeps logging me out my own account on the browser,negative
"I have spotify premium and I can completely recommend it. The algorithm is very good I discovered so many artists and songs thanks to him. The design is simple and pretty, the app has a lot of features and is very intuitive to use. I never had any technical problems either.",positive
Love Spotify I can find my music in a matter of seconds but there's a bug I'll tap on one so g and it will put a whole different artist and song on but otherwise it is a great appðŸ˜˜ðŸ’•ðŸ’…ðŸ’…,positive
Extremely good app,positive
"stuck on splash screen, tried installing and uninstalling but it still doesnt work",negative
I'm enjoying this app cuz it allows for various playlists & different styles of music depending on my mood/occasion.,positive
"The app is trash! Buggy interface, and the video feed randomly disappears.. I have a subscription just for podcasts and I feel like a sucker.. what are you trying to be Spotify? I only associate your name with this lackluster app... be better ðŸ‘",negative
Very easy interface and not glitchy at all work great in old device but the musics dont have high bass. at some point there is no bass at where it should be other than great app,negative
Nice except ads,positive
Ever since I started using it I've never downloaded music. I just listen to playlists according to the mood in feeling. Great app!,positive
"F this app. At first it was a very good music app, but now I can't listen to the songs I want to, because every time I click the play button it automaticly switches to a completely different song which I have never heard of. Spotify fix your fckjng app!!!",positive
I have been using Spotify from about 2 years and yeah THE BEST MUSIC APP I HAVE USED (AND WILL BE BE USING IT TOO),positive
When I try the app it is good but on the 2nd day theres a bug that I can't play any music because if I play a music or anything it will force stop even with wifi connections. I tried to uninstall and install it but nothing still have the bug. Pls help,negative
I love Spotify. I just wish it were a little less expensive. The trial period definitely gets you hooked.,positive
"Awesome gospel songs. Good selection process of genre, no buffering, just as good as playing the cds directly uninterupted. Great app!!",positive
e we do jukn ede u u vv a clip to paste it in the text box.Tap on a clip to buy saved here.u call wi,negative
"Having the same issue as other people, it randomly stops playing at times. Controls disappear so I need to force close and reopen, several times to get it working again. New issue is if my screen turns off the podcast starts jittering. No settings have changed like data limitation, battery saver, etc. It's progressively getting worse. The newest update has solved nothing for me either. Please fix these issues!",negative
Excellent music player,positive
It's super app for listening music but it has more advertisement ðŸ¥± it is very bad ðŸ˜” can you please remove the ads from Spotify,negative
"This application was irritating me very much, such a useless application it is. Even I had good internet connection it shows me no internet connection. Dose it trying to fool me? If I shuffle play then it plays. But I'm not able to choose a song to play because it shows no internet connection. Posted this one year back still not resolved such a useless maintenance and management.",negative
"This app is really great and has any song you could think of. However, my issues are that when you search a song you can't play it just plays a bunch of different songs. Also, it only allows you to skip six songs per hour (which is EXTREMELY ANNOYING). Lastly, when you create a playlist it just adds random songs that usually aren't to my preference.",negative
"I love this app,it's my best music source!",positive
"Your app is genuinely pathetic. It takes multiple minutes to load a simple playlist, even on desktop. Be thankful you have no real competition, because you wouldn't last a week if you did.",negative
Brilliant! Very pleased with the ability to listen to all gender of music and arrange it into play lists for playback.,positive
It's an amazing app and I guess there is a new feature in it like a karaoke one and I love it but I can't find the option now can you guys please bring it back but otherwise its a great app I am living it .,positive
"Pretty good other than the queue option. When you want to go to the previous queued track, the queue gets lost for some reason and it plays a different song?!",positive
"Ok i don't have premium subscription but what does it mean..? It's almost after every single song, i have to suffer with add.. Too irritating and tired of this now..",negative
Spotify is a crook I'm being charged twice a month for my premium account ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ,negative
This verry good music platform Thank you,positive
"My Repeat button just completely disappeared and I try updating the app and more, but nothing works. I'm done with this app.",negative
A brilliant app especially for self development podcasts,positive
"App has been starting to be buggy. My problem that I am experiencing is that offline mode does not show my downloaded songs, but when I go online, it says they are downloaded. Please fix this issue.",negative
I give it 4 cause it's good but the ads for premium is annoying and you cant download songs only with premium ita annoying but its good,positive
"Really like my Spotify, it has everything I need in a music app. The family plan is great if you're like me and have multiple family members living in one home. I have had all the music apps at one time or another, Spotify continues to be my favorite.",positive
Lot of ads,negative
Please fix all the glitches - so annoying. When using Android wireless headphones the 'now playing' display disappears and there is no way to stop or skip songs. You have to annually close out the app. App just randomly stops playing.,negative
the app is easy to use.,positive
Great selection of music and podcasts,positive
Very technical songs ðŸ‘,positive
"The app itself is good. Music selection is good. However, I have a huge problem with a certain heavily promoted podcast that is spewing vaccine misinformation, so I have cancelled my premium subscription and uninstalled the app. I want this stupid pandemic to be over already, and there is no way I'm giving another penny to a company that actively refuses to take down information that is literally leading to people's deaths. Shame on you for putting profits over human lives, Spotify.",negative
The reason why I rate 1 star is about ads like 1 song i played 3 ads I am sick of that and i never make A video out of it bcz Like i never can Listen one song full Bcz its keep Out and i gotta go back to on it but it is 1 sec in like I hate this Now,negative
seriously so good. their system is great. music wow ðŸ˜».,positive
I love Spotify! It's so nice being able to listen to lovely classical music ðŸŽ¶ ðŸ’—ðŸ’œâ™¾ï¸,positive
It's a very nice app. I like it and I have always liked it. I just hope they reduce the ads for those who aren't using premium.,positive
Great to find almost any artist but what I really like is the recommendations that Spotify makes. Much of my new favorite artists were recommended so good job!,positive
App is broken right now. Pauses every few minutes and the play bar goes away so you have no way to pause or skip the audio. This last update needs patched or rolled back asap. Paying premium but can't use the app for most of the month is unacceptable,negative
Please share with me how do I access changing my password since it is forgotten I can't listen to Spotify on my TV only this cell phone if I can't access updating my password I will be taking this off my phone for permanent I'm not going to join if I can't access and listen,negative
"I like Spotify even more now that there's lyrics to the songs. I also like Spotify because I can leave the app, do other things on my phone and still be able to listen to the music.",positive
I normally love this!!! Its life!!! BUT lately it cuts out all the time. I have to touch the screen on my phone for it to turn back on. Wildly frustrating! I hope this is just a temporary problem!,negative
"Too much ads, moreover ads took more around like 1 minutes, really discouraging.Always asking to go for premium.Please reduce ads time.Sometime I just open Spotify to listen music for a short time but ads always come up ðŸ™‚",negative
Works as advertised! Everything I want and need. Also love the fact that I don't have to worry about sensorship. They don't remove stuff because it goes against mainstream propaganda.,positive
Spotify is way better than Pandora,positive
Without money . . . .Too much adds. After every song there is add.,negative
"I honestly really don't like this app. On a phone, spotify adds songs to your playlist, FYI I hate the songs they add, YOU CAN'T EVEN LISTEN TO ONE SONG without having to listen to a WHOLE PLAYLIST. SO much advertisements. Ugh i hate it so much. This is a scam you have to download premium to be able to do simple stuff like skip a song or listen to one song. It's literally just a scam for money, I don't reccomend installing Spotify",negative
"Please include the ""Add to Queue"" function to the ""What's New"" section.",negative
"I get to listen to all my favorite s***, on one list super dope.",positive
It's awesomeness man you can use as background but the dowload you need to pay,negative
Very good experience I can turn Spotify on my favorite music and listen to it all the way from Virginia to New York never have to change the station never miss a beat Spotify is great,positive
You have to buy access to songs instead of playing with shuffle.aaaa,negative
App is good but most of the time it just stops responding i use Spotify on daily basis and on every second day i faced this issue that app lags and stops responding and sometimes it doesn't show the music controls when i tap to play music I'm a premium member so what's the point of subscribing to this service if these kind of issues keep happening please fix this,negative
It is amazing u get to listen to any podcasts any music,positive
Very Authentic in its own way,positive
No longer works in my car. And yes it's this app. Pandora works just fine.,positive
Sometimes has troubles loading up pls fix that,negative
The most wonderful app for music.... Jst love itðŸ˜˜,positive
This new update is really bad. Too many glitches....I Pay premium membership so this annoys me and irritates me when I'm driving and the music suddenly stops nor can I see it on my notifications bar. Please fix this asap and keep us up to Date when it's fixed. Really disappointing!,negative
I loved when i downloaded it but after like one week it's forcing to buy the premium version. I can't even play i single song without buying it. It's really annoying! I loved this app & keep wanted to use it but...,negative

Very cool app. It works very well for me with many genre of music from which to choose.,positive
...'plugged' in a few artists and get more artists and tunes I like.,positive
"Y'know spotify is such a convenience I never thought to rate it, spotify without premium is okay you can listen to your music only online, you have limited skips, and you can only do shuffle play, but where it really gets good, you can listen to music offline, listen in to music with friends if you see them listening to music on discord, you can create playlists with your friends, you even get a ton of extra settings to adjust your music how you'd like it, spotify even makes playlists for you!",positive
I like it. My car system wakes it up on my phone,positive
I request to Spotify give us adds but dont do these kind of updates that you cant play that song againno shuffle modeno play backplay next  MUSIC IS EMOTION AND YOU ARE PLAYING WITH EMOTIONS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE  So I request to please remove all these barriers give us that old Spotify,positive
Great and easy to use,positive
Was not able to listen to podcast. Said there was no internet connection. Funny thing is that I had internet connection for everything else I wanted to do online. Not pleased at all.,negative
Have no control to skip song or to pause,negative
I use this everyday and works exactly like need it to. I love how they have started adding lyrics to the music. Hopefully lyrics will be available for every song on Spotify.,positive
Not good at all because we can't hear our favourite song without interruption of ads and for that also there are asking for money and i Don't like that Chand baliyan song at all but only that ad interrupt everytime boring song which always change my mind from listening to music and i just like to hit my phone very hard when that Chand baliyan song will comeðŸ˜•,negative
I pay for this service and it hasn't disappointed me yet.,positive
They never Miss a Beat !! I can get all genre of music along with My Favorite PODCASTS !!! Thank you SPOTIFY,positive
A idea for Spotify: Imagine being able to choose the years of your favorite singers activities and just listen to the period of songs produced in those years. I hope can see this option soon in the Spotify,positive
Wow this app is amazing ..i gives all kinds of music ..from your favourite artists ..,positive
"Hi,I love this app but when I play my playlist it as songs I didn't put on it also can you add a loop button I hate that I can't hear my favorite song over and over again I'm sorry if I'm sounding mean but I just want a loop button and not listen to songs that I did add to my playlist please that's all.",positive
"As a podcast player, this app is a bit annoying when trying to listen to a queue of episodes. For such a popular player, I can't believe that they have no way to sort them by oldest to newest on Android, only newest to oldest.",negative
I wish in the premium duo there is a chat session too!!... Which we can communicate each other easily i wish this update come up soon.,negative
I am new to this and honestly I don't know how a major app like this one can't allow u to just shut down the music when u leave the app or even allow u to not auto reconnect to it every time u use Bluetooth. Seriously I tried everything but still the music plays on unless I pause it which means it's not stopped just paused and so uses my batter for no reason .that's why I deleted it,negative
The selection is great and always current with the shows. For anime the dub is a little behind but the sub is always current.,positive
Easy to get around app but music to add ratio is more adds that music,positive
I hated the ads but i love spotify because theres so many different song and it adds extra bass to the song 8/10,positive
"It's not working, unresponsive",negative
So many adds! And distasteful adds. At least 3 or 4nat a time! Can't even skip or replay songs??? What a joke.,negative
"Superb, please add offline with download for offline listening. Overall have a great experience",positive
"Horrible app when I try to play any song it plays a different song, artists, and genre it sucks",negative
Why is it so damn difficult (if not impossible) to find a song and just play it?,negative
Good for streaming! ðŸ‘,positive
Why does Spotify not treat metered WiFi connections like mobile data? It shouldn't refresh downloaded songs upon connecting to a metered WiFi connection like it does. Please stop chewing through my data. Why does the media player notification come back every time I lock the phone? If I dismiss the notification that means I'm done and you're now bugging me tokeep playing.,negative
"Control panel is disappeared, which disallowe to switch or stop music. I reinstall it number of times. Never had a problem with previous version. Time to say goodbye to subscription ðŸ˜’",negative
Overall terrible experience you can't even find the single song you want to listen to you have to shuffle through songs you don't like until you get the ONE song that you were trying to LISTEN to,negative
To many ads i get 6 ads after every 2-3 songs Pandora is a lot more better then this,negative
The only reason I had this app was for the Joe rogan podcasts...way to bow down and be controlled. Your an embarrassment.,negative
"Don't recommend, literally can't skip more than 6 songs for an entire hour, counting if you skip the random song that they recommend you even if you don't it.",positive
I'll give y'all a 3 not because I hate it. This actually has to be one of my favorite apps but I'm a premium user and y'all still won't show my lyrics tab. I have upgraded and reinstalled so manyyy times!! Like come on.,negative
This is amazing they have a free trial i love this app,positive
"Good, but crashes when I open the podcast menu for the first time in a while. When I open the app again, it's fixed but it's a slight annoyance.",negative
Great music. Easy to navigate.,positive
I have found the bug in your application when dark mode activate that time the timing line didn't come,negative
Really like their set up and it's user friendly!!!,positive
When creating a playlist Spotify adds songs that it thinks you'll like to that playlist. There is no way to turn this feature off.,negative
"The latest update causes an annoying ""enable Bluetooth on Android 12!"" popup literally every day, despite me USING Bluetooth. This also completely disabled the ability to view the currently playing music and removes all ability to control it (play/pause/skip/rewind) via either phone or headphone controls until the app is force-closed and relaunched. This renders the app nearly useless.",negative
"Spotify did work brilliant but recently I have been having issues. When I play music or a podcast the pause button has disappeared and it appears on the interface as if nothing is playing. It the randomly stops and if I press play music/podcast go back to the beginning. Also, if I am connected to a device via Bluetooth and then disconnect music/podcast carry on playing through my phone and the only way to stop it is to quit the app. Very frustrating.",negative
The really incredible I mean it's super duper easy to use and has really good music,positive
Spotify kinda sucks without premium but with premium it easily the best music app.,positive
"I really like using this but of recently I've not been able to pay for the premium package, I want to, but it keeps declining my card, i would really like you guys to look into this",negative
"Keeps crashing in my android phone but works perfect in my iphone. I tried resetting my phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, force stopping the app, but still it keeps crashing.",positive
"I have the premium because I'm music obsessed. I hope their pricing policy does not change. With give playlists - one of which has over 20 hours of songs - I could get billed for more than ten and change a month. So the limitless on the size of playlists is awesome, and I can look to add music at any time.",positive
Terrific ads,positive
"Not perfect, but does most everything I want. Easy to navigate and manage music and playlists.",positive
"I HATE IT that Spotify has to add their horrible recommendations to my playlist! This is absolutely stupid and plays songs from artists I don't even care about. I made a playlist to listen to 1 artist only, not a mix of unrelated artists. No wonder people are deleting your stupid app when you do things like this.",negative
Hey there's a recent bug where Spotify decides to not count as playing however it will play audio. Becomes irritating because you cannot stop the audio without swiping the app away Pixel 5 Android 12 AT&T Make sure to reply when you fix so I can put this back at 5 stars,negative
"Just. Amazing. But I gotta warn you tho, you can't really enjoy this app to the fullest with just the free version, the update sucks, really showed how eager Spotify is for peoples money, because of the update, I had no choice but to buy premium, boooo hoo, overall though, 4.3 stars,",negative
"Better than Pandora!!!! Im a new member and its the bomb!!! It made a play list based on what i listen to... Sooo AWESOME!!!! Update, still bomb app!!! Feeling it tough!!",negative
The best app. Music is everything and Spotify makes it easy to get it,positive
"Everything is OK but it will be better if you don't give so many ads, and one more thing there are not many songs like jin's super tuna and more",negative
"The new version (8.7.34.1317) fix my problem, now i can enjoy play music again, spotify is my fav music player right now Good job dev, thanks.",positive
"I have used this app for the last 2 years straight, always use premium, it's an essential",positive
"I love spotify and have been using it for years. The only reason I'm giving a 4 star rating is because I can't (personally) view lyrics on mobile. I have a Samsung galaxy s21 and previous a s8, both would not allow me to view lyrics.",negative
"I know ads are necessary for non paid users but seriously after every 1 min there is a ad.. it's too much, when I start using Spotify they give ads after 30-20 mins.. but nowdays they are giving ads for literally every songs... Spotify is a good app no doubt, for free users there will be ads but please set some limits man...",positive
The sudden crashes would happen everyday that it's getting annoying,negative
Lots of add,positive
Always been a good music provider ive had them over 5 years,positive
Watch a ad u will get 30 minutes ad free music where 30 mins ad free every 10 to 15 mins plays a ad what's the hell is making false promise ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,negative
Not got an issue really got everything im looking for only down side would be the price for multiple accounts,negative
My sibling and I both don't have premium yet I seem to get a LOT more ads than they do. I get ads maybe every two or three songs while they can listen to ten songs without a single ad interrupting it. This is incredibly annoying.,negative
I like it I searching my favorite song... ðŸ¤©â¤ï¸,positive
Spotify keep crashing when I play music ðŸ˜­,negative
Superb quality. Funtastic podcasts. And all the songs available.... In short entertainment at our earpods....,positive
You will find truly amazing music of all genre as well as the podcasts of today's most influential hosts with many interesting topics!,positive
Gave Adele a touch too much exposure. Nothing technically wrong with that. Julian Alvarez understands. Almost as good as Beppe Grillo basically.,positive
"Terrible app experience. Keeps pausing, controls aren't shown. After having premium for years I am strongly considering ditching Spotify completely. Why pay for a service that doesn't work?",negative
"Since the new update, I can't actually see what song is playing in my notifications widget. I actually have to go into the app to skip or do anything. Swiping down on notifications doesn't show that Spotify is actually active",negative
"Ok, what is wrong here? The new ""improvements"" are really bad! The person in charge of removing the interface for instant stop and play and other simple music listening functions, just in the bottom of the app, really has to rethink the results! Fix it! Edit: in my anger I wrote this before installing the update. Actually really fast fixed! It's fine again.",negative
Nice for listening to music I love it,positive
It is an amazing app you should try it no ads,positive
"There are way too many ads, and they come in sets of three!",negative
Great app and I have hundreds of hours listened on it but it can still be better with some better algorithm improvements like YT music has Great overall though,positive
Fun.lots of entertainment.I just find the app to be great,positive
Trying it our with light piano ðŸŽ¹ music ðŸŽ¶..very relaxing.,positive
"Galaxy Z fold 3 has an app breaking issue where it says ""nothing playing"" although it's constantly playing whatever I click. Have had this issue for several months through several updates.",negative
"I used to love this app, it's very relaxing & u can pick any song u want. But I'm very disappointed on the new update, it doesn't let u skip some part of the song & it also won't let u pick any song u like, it will just played a random song. I CANT EVEN PLAY MY OWN PLAYLIST CUZ OF THE SHUFFLE, very disappointing but I'm still hoping the next time y'all update this app, pls remove the shuffle thing & the part when it won't let u skip some part of the song. I hope y'all understand :)",negative
The reason why it's a 4 and not a five is cause when I search a song when I press the song I want to listen to its a completely different song and it's very annoying like right now I wanted to listen to the song thumbs by Sabrina carpenter and instead when I pressed it I got the song soldier by Samantha jade but I would rate this app a five but not right now,negative
"I have never taken to this app. I like to own a physical version of my favourite music. Ive gone back to buying Cds. If someone hadn't sold my albums id go straight back to viynal too. Hate ""steaming""",negative
telling 30 minute unintrupted song..every after 2 songs ads comes.. uninstalled ta ta..,negative
I love my Spotify premium on my phone so I don't have to go through all the ads definitely recommend the premium if you live in small towns with spotty service. Definitely not a huge fee either!,negative
"Spotify, you make all my wet dreams come true. I can't thank you enough.",positive
"Update made this app a headache it plays sometimes sometimes it doesn't it wont even play ""download"" songs",negative
After update apps keep crashing pleas fix it!!! PS: install Spotify lite for continue listening for temporary solution until got fixed. Hope it helps,negative
I am using spotify premium for the last 1 year and recently the app just doesn't play the songs as it pauses at times even when the internet is good. It pauses in the middle which shouldn't be happening. But overall the experience is still good. I would still recommend spotify.,positive
Spotify is dope. I pay for premium which isn't too expensive if you look at a lot of other streaming services now and I know of all the services I pay for Spotify will probably be the only thing I keep if 5jings get tight. Priorities man. Music/ podcasts.,negative
An exceptional excellent app which has potential to create great history in different applications of musical industry. By improving one of the quality is uninterruptible adds service provision. Thanks. Best of luck for future goals and variable characteristics that would be brought to enhance its genuine authenticity.,positive
"Don't have to worry about loosing the music I love again. Really easy to use and has a great algorithm that points me to other musicians. I really hope that these bands get something for their time, they are true lifesavers. Thank you Bands/spotify",positive
"The songs that I choose are entirely different, when I click the song I want to play it plays a different song but it still has the album cover with the play button but the song playing is different, hope you can fix this",positive
Been using Spotify since day one,negative
just start with this app will update later so far so good Some time has passed and I am pleased with this app. just need to figure it out a little more. Keep up the good work ðŸ‘.,positive
"Ideal for listening to music, at home, office, or when travellling. Fantastic",positive
"Tommytechno Love the easy way to get new music and the new enhance engine to find good track for playlist, just miss video mix when releases new videos and track hope it will come soon.",negative
It was great but as of recently I turn on the app and all there it shows is a black screen with the bell and setting icons that don't work and then it says that it's not responding.,negative
Best app around for building playlists and listening ad free. I've tried them all but Spotify is number one for me.,positive
I love this music app. It's well worth the money each month to be able to enjoy endless music ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽµ,positive
Removed Pawan Kalyan Tholiprema Album etc,positive
Good,positive
"When I ask my phone assistance to play a playlist by name, it always plays Spotify's garbage pre-made playlists Don't want to pay monthly to not hear my music",negative
Way better than pandora,positive
I think the app is overall good to use with the amount of playlists they have and it is very user friendly. But my main thing is I mainly listen to music but have SOOOOO many podcasts popping up instead. I listen to a few podcasts and way more music but see more podcasts. If they could separate them that would be way better. Other than that it's not to bad.,negative
Keeps playing stuff other than the play list I created,negative
The hardest to navigate app I have ever used. I use it almost daily and still aways have issues navigating.,negative
Loving it so far. Would recommend over Apple Music any day.,positive
"However old however young, spotify has the music etc",positive
Fabiless,positive
Super,positive
"What happened to the app?, i can't play the songs i want to play and it keeps shuffling to a different song.",negative
"I don't think i need to convince anybody how good this app is really, everyone knows its the best music app lol, the audio is so crisp and such good quality, for listening with headphones or outloud on your phone or with speakers. ðŸ¤Ÿ",positive
"Love Spotify. I've been a longtime user. But right now the app is barely worth 2 stars. I don't know if this is because of this latest update, or what, but it has been bugging out MAJORLY. I have to shut down the app and re-open it almost every second time I want to change a song. It's brutal.",negative
Sad that Spotify will keep people that push disinformation because it brings in advertising dollars and pushes people off their platform like Neil Young who speaks the truth. I'm out of here and deleting the app for good.,negative
"Whats with all the Bugs Lately?? Crashes, etc.",negative
Spotify is a very good app just when I listen to ads the song starts playing in between Otherwise its just great to listen to Ads,positive
It's OK. But it continues to remove the music I've got in my playlist even after I downloaded them.,negative
"Love this app. But only listen 1-2x week, 1-2hrs. Price is high for me.",positive
Awesome... I can stream my favorite jams at work on the road...anywhere I go.,positive
Spotify please fix the bug where It keeps playing music and I can't pause it. I can still play music but the controls won't show up. It happens when I use spotify for more than 20 mins. Only way to fix it is to close app and open it. I have s22 ultra if that helps.,negative
"It would be great if this app could play music. It constantly stops for no reason, the playback notification disappears, and I just see ""Spotify is trying to play."" It also will sometimes continue playing when the notification has disappeared, leaving no way to pause music.",negative
"Spotify let's me have the kind of music anybody wants when they visit. An added bonus is I can turn it on, change volume, or Switch genres or songs or with my cell at the blink of an eye. Thank you, Spotify",positive
Will just turn itself on whenever Bluetooth is connected regardless if the app is open or even playing at the time. Entirely obnoxious and unwanted. I'm uninstalling the app right now,negative
This app has everything you'd want for your music! And weekly updates based on your taste! The new remote bluetooth feature is incredible and fun! My phone doesn't have to stay on the whole time. Best music app ever!,positive
The free version of this app is missing key features that are in the PC version. There is no reason to not offer a comparable experience across platforms and seriously hurt my score of it,negative
Good app as it has loads of choice and gels well especially on the long drives and road trips .,positive
It's good but my problem is you can't play the music that you search properly it's like you play a song you press the play button and sometimes it plays a different music and if you play your playlist you can only play it in shuffle you can't play it the way you intended to and it has ads if you really want to use it without the ads you can play music properly etc then get the premium,negative
The update is Soo bad. I can't pause or skip songs and it doesn't even let you listen to the song you want. This app was good before.,negative
Been using this app for as long as I can remember and all I can say is that this is the best music streaming app that I've ever used. Been a premium user since 2019 and was satisfied with the benefits. Never encountered any problems or whatever in this app so I'm very happy. I absolutely love the Blend feature right now cause I was able to match with my friends' music tastes. This has served as my comfort since I learned to use it. So this is a 5/5 because I'm being generous lol.,positive
"Where did the sing mode go, it was really fun!",positive
This app sucks they force you to get premium so you can hear the actual song you wanna listen to but if you dont have premium you hear kids songs,negative
In the last version my Now Playing bar regularly disappears. Haven't found a way to get it back or to stop whatever is playing other than by force closing the app. Would be nice to get this fixed...,negative
why remove the toggle button for offline mode as most users rely on the quick function to save data usage? won't be renewing my subscription,negative
i love this bc it sooooo awesome and i can listen to my own music without my sibling knowing what ilisten to,positive
GREAT!I love listening to music and playing my favorite playlist!It's a great app if you like music,positive
"As someone who appreciates and relies on music for my overall well-being, I can't go a day without using this valuable app!",positive
It's nice I wish one doesn't have to stick on one selected songs but can make a change of choice of music songs and artists.,positive
"I mostly love Spotify, especually since Joe Rogan's on here. It would be cool if we got suggested playlist made by other people.",positive
"Easy and nice, thanks.",positive
the song keeps stopping. i press another song when a song is playing and the entire app glitches and no songs begin to play,negative
"I really enjoyed using this application.You can listen to all kinds of music on it.Because I am a Muslim, I listen to a lot of Islamic music.I have innumerable Naats in my library.This is a very good application.",positive
Good sound and song experience,positive
Great choices of music and seem to be for Free Speech so you get 5* from me boo,negative
"Too many issues going on with the app lately that make it horrible to use. Tracks and podcasts will stop playing randomly and will often restart. Extremely annoying having to find the place you were at in a long podcast. The ""fix"" to the issue is to Uninstall and reinstall, but that only works for so long. I have done it myself 5 times now. Giving it a month to be fixed before I end my subscription.",negative
Too bad after the new update can not listen to the song I want to plus I even lost my old account I can not log in my old account i have to make a new one,negative
Best app ever but you have to keep a option for downloading music...so please keep the option... So you will have more public to come,negative
I love that I can have multiple Playlist and can access them at anytime and anywhere,positive
"The heart button doesn't work, so I can't add songs to my liked songs",negative
Too much ad!!! I will rather prefer reso..,negative
"Gosh! Completely recommend.. best app to listen music ever! But only irritating thing is ads. It says 30 min uninterrupted listening after small ad, but for every 2 songs in a playlist, it displays an ad. Frustrating. But 30 min feature is very good, only if you follow it correctly.",positive
Spotify is good Because we can choose any music we want so we don't need YouTube,positive
I have had issues with my shuffle forever where it just doesn't shuffle. I will end up ollistening to about 5-10 songs on repeat. I have tried to reach out to customer service and they have repeated made it clear that I am the on responsible to fix things. That is correct they want me the customer to fix the bugs with the app. Don't waste your money I hear apple music has better customer service and the exact same music selection!,negative
"Spotify asking me to give them 5 star rating, personally I think they are equivalent to I-heart, Pandora, and the rest. They are all pretty good.",positive
Hi @Spotify @SpotifyCares We noticed that the song 'MONEY' by LISA on some of your playlists including TTH has been replaced with an unauthorized song with an identical name. Hope you fix this immediately. Thank you. Please take action,negative
"When I would search for an artist in a playlist and hit shuffle play, it would shuffle play the songs from that artist only. Now it just shuffle plays from the whole playlist. Fix this please coz this is a hugh thing for me",positive
Keeps crashing. All the time.,negative
"Used to be ok, now it's impossible to change podcast listening order on desktop. It's reverse chronological no matter how you sort it. The ""fix"" is to use the mobile app to play the first episode, then the autoqueue actually works. The issue with that is that the mobile app is also bugged and only displays the information of the first episode played, just adding the next episode's run time to the first one. This jacks up the 15s rewind button by making the entire episode start over instead.",negative
Can find all the music I want and works offline anywhere so it's great for my job,positive
"I keep getting ""No internet"" which essentially breaks the app. Now I think it's because an update is needed but what kind of application gives a completely unrelated error message when an update is needed?? Oh yeah, and let us customise our home screen! We don't want to see thay idiot Joe Rogan every time we launch the app.",negative
Really good. The music is awesome the podcasts are great . But the only problem I have is that the ads are coming in the middlecofxa song and it kinda makes me mad but other than that it's a pretty good app and it's totally worth trying!ðŸ˜ƒ,positive
Unusable after premium membership ended. Extremely buggy,negative
The app is perfect but after I cancelled my subscription Thay take the money every month non stop. In the app it's saying Free Account and still take the money.,negative
I goet to listen to all my favorite songs at once it's so amazing!ðŸ˜,positive
"I absolutely love it, the playlists completely suit my taste, my sister had it and we would always use it to play taylor swift when ever we went driving, I had no idea it was free! It was too good to be true but it was.",positive
Glitchy. Have to keep restarting it. Suddenly stops playing. I think the glitch is triggered when the on screen ads pop up.,negative
"It's a great music app but, about the updates! UGH! I'm literally updating daily...just check the probs!",negative
I cant play music unless I shuffle the music and can't even listen to my Playlist,negative
"Where is my Car Mode?! You deleted it? Whyy, it was so useful, now i need to lock into phone during driving to change song.. thats stupid.",negative
"Okay im not sure if this happens to anyone else. But when im on spotify input some music When i exit the app the for a few minutes it stops playing, idk why it happens and im on android. Please fix this bug or idk what it is",negative
"Where had the pause and stop display gone? Can skip to next track, or anything without having to close the app on the mobile. Why has this been changed? Is not improved it at all",negative
Very good remastering of oldies. Exceptional excellence. My sincerest gratitude to Spotify.,positive
I love Spotify!!,positive
"Its the best songs app but, without internet its nkt availalable if u have'nt subscribed",negative
I did love using Spotify! Not anymore since I'm ANNOYED that ALL of my playlists are gone for some reason...,negative
This app is very boring and contains so much ads don't download if you taking subscription then it is ok,positive
Awesome and cheap! Use it everyday and I have a premium account! I uses use pandora but they had a limited selection so I decided to try this and it's awesome (please free my family),positive
Would rate 5 stars if it didn't cut out constantlyðŸ˜¡,negative
"best app for music and recommendations is very fabulous.. thank you team @Spotify â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸,,",positive
Best app for music With the best playlists,positive
It is great but it would be better if I were able to play specific songs I want to listen to instead of shuffling the whole playlist.,positive
It's really so good and best app specially for musics and songs ðŸ¥°,positive
Sound should be increased to best experience,negative
We should be able to listen to downloaded songs without the need to turn on 'offline mode' from the settings. Spotify is by far the most user-unfriendly subsasubscription based streaming app I've used.,negative
It always says I'm offline even on a super fast network & search doesn't work. It makes the app useless. This started in the recent builds from last 10 days or so Apart from that Amazing app. You have the fastest streaming service I have used really amazing. These feature requests look to be done 1.Reduce the amount of space it uses in my disk. 2.Genre playlist which plays songs in all languages in that genre Thanks for that.,negative
i cant play my favorite song because its playing different song fix this!!!!ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,negative
so i love spotify but as you see there is only four stars this is why there is to many ads i know that this is online but if there is a way to stop the ads i would like that and there is fake playlists so that too. and i want you to put more songs on it is ok but ig if you just do that then it would be better ty. btw you dont need to here is the good things.well if in unhappy i alway listen to one of the songs on spotify it makes me happy i love sub urben so like i that singer and ya.,negative
"Love the service and amount music, podcasts that I can find.",positive
"I can't get access easily to the songs that I want to listen to When I press ""play"" it play a different song than what I chose!",positive
It's good for when you are interested in music and you can use it on a google. I use it everyday and it is easy to develop and you can even become someone (Artist) who puts music on spotify. I am a profile called Matteo Loriente and I have about 20 playlists and 10 followers!,positive
One of the best music streaming out there!,positive
"I can't listen to some podcasts while in airplane mode/offline. Yes, I even turned on offline mode. Absolutely trash. I'm going to switch music platforms when I get home.",negative
"used for 3 years, and I felt like the ads are increasing. Almost after every one song would be followed on by an ad, and it's always the same ads. Not everyone can afford premium.",negative
Cost a lot but the service is very good.,positive
Love it - so many songs at my fingertips.,positive
this app sucks. i cant choose which song i want to listen to.the playlist just plays. there are limited skips. hate this app.,negative
Best app for the songs,positive
exceptional app.. the new version is amazing!,positive
"With no excuses , this is the best app for play music .",positive
It used to be ok because you would get ads like every 5 minutes or something like that but now it's awesome because I think they removed ads or I have premium and just don't know it either way I'm not complaining it's an awsome place to listen to music on,positive
"Terribly optimised for android. The music skips randomly, the now playing bar dissapears, and playlists randomly undowload themselves",negative
Too many ads.. even after 1 song ðŸ˜”,negative
It's good and I've enjoyed it very much it helps me release my stress through music,positive
"it plays one song and completely quits, and now it's not even playing my playlist and if im lucky it will play but it plays songs that aren't in the playlist and aren't even similar to my playlist. so, here i am uninstalling AGAIN. it keeps giving like 4+ ads before playing one song and then it plays more ads and just completely quits. fix it, it's become horrible lately.",negative
Constantly crashes with podcasts which is annoying. Plus the podcast video player could really use an update.,negative
Says I'm offline when I'm not. It doesn't pause for at least 30 seconds after I hit pause. Glitches continue even after deleting cache and reinstalling. Please fix this damn app! I'm very close to heading to Tidal or even Deezer if this doesn't get fixed!,negative
"Search history has today disappeared for no good reason. Seems like Spotify consistently fix one thing, and then break another.",negative
A platform that actually does support full free speach and my number one favorite app for music/podcasts. Spotify is one of the only platforms that knows that more content and speach is always better. Spotify has nearly anything on the app. I've had it for at least 5 years now. Highly recommend.,positive
Lovely to have all your music at your fingertips.,positive
Very easy and an enjoyable app to florish you with good hearings,positive
The update is suck i cant listen to the music that i want like it's a whole album then it's gonna shuffle,positive
Worth the money. You can enjoy music anywhere and everywhere.,positive
I don't have many things to say about Spotify...It was more good if all the lyrics are in English....now it is like the lyrics is in the language which the song belongs to...It makes us difficult to sing... That's the only thing that I felt bad...Every settings else is very good end comfortable ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–Anyway I love Spotify alotðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,positive
"Best app for music and new discoveries. The a.i. recommendations to similar artists/albums, is second to none, a must though is membership. But worth every penny if you are a fellow music fan. Would give 100 stars if I could; spotify has re-ignited my passion in listening to good, new (and old) music.",positive
I'm in awe that I have to pay a subscription just to turn off the shuffle on mobile app this just tells us that your money hungry,negative
I'll never spay for Sporify so long as they support Joe Rogan's misinformation or take money from Kroger who chose closing stores over paying pandemic hazard pay.,negative
"Keeps stopping, and I can't find the song I'm playing, can't stop or change what I'm listening to. This is just in the last couple of days so hopefully can be fixed.",negative
"please make premium purchases on Spotify, you can use credit because there are people who don't have a debit card",negative
I made a playlist and it added so many more song then I asked for now I dislike the playlist why cant they just let me play the songs I put cause I never put the rest and it's very irritating,negative
Thai is so much,positive
I should be able to listen to my music in the way i sort it.,positive
LIKE,positive
I love this app,positive
I absolutely love Spotify! I get to listen to all my favorite songs whenever I want!! I have premium and it is just amazing,positive
"It use so much battery this app, which doesn't make sense for a music player app. The app is full of random bugs, for example if you try to play a song it might not work and you need to click it again, it happens very rarely though.",negative
One of my Favourite App ever coz I used ganaa and Saavn but nothing can give the satisfaction coz the ad experience was very bad Now I used the Spotify and its very good now Thank you Spotify ,positive
Excellent sound quality. Search engine is relevant and swift. Great app,positive
The best algorithm its my best friend Thank you ,positive
Everything is fine but Equilizer option should near player options but it is in the settings. We need to follow very long path just to enable equilizer. I think that is only wrost part of this app.,negative
"Sometimes randomly stops working for half a day and selection can be minimalistic at times. But, mainly has what I want to listen to and I love the fun of maintaining my playlists. Also love that I can connect with my family and we can share a list but not our whole account! Would give 4.5 if I could.",positive
Good App,positive
Absolutely Iove this thing,positive
"For all the money and resources Spotify has from barely paying the artists on their platform, you would think they might put some of that money into having a really good app that functions well and doesn't crash or bug our constantly. But you'd be wrong for thinking that.",positive
"Great streaming app....except there are a great number of tracks that aren't available, or aren't available offline even when downloaded.",negative
Great app! However Spotify likes to stop playing my music randomly I'm working out or doing something and the music just stops and then it resets the song to the beginning its espically annoying when your in the middle of somthing and the app keeps saying to allow background activity even when it's on.,negative
Very good app to listen to music with all facilities and user friendly interface,positive
It's good but sometimes all song are repeating,positive
I enjoy the app but wish it wouldn't randomly stop playing. I also wish new episodes off my subscribed podcast would populat on the home page.,negative
"Needs a serious update, barely functional. Crashes randomly, play button disappears, nothing in the library section will load offline despite being downloaded.",negative
Everything is good rather then downloading songs for which you have to purchase primium membership and you also can't stream songs on the highest quality unless you buy the membership. Edit : I've purchased the membership and the experience is flawless.,positive
Too Many Ads,negative
A chance to reverse songs on free tear,negative
"Love the options to see the Playlist. Sometimes I am not close to my technology to rate a song while playing, later am able to swipe to see what just played and click on the heart.",positive
"Scince the new update, I can't see the lyrics for any song. I really want this bug to get fixed. I have always loved and used spotify",negative
Interface must be improve. It is not userfriendly.,negative
I love Spotify don't get me wrong but the new update drives me crazy I can't click on the song I want to listen to any more. I have to go search the song but then it still is on a random play and I still can't listen to the song I want to.,negative
Broken. No video when Bluetooth connected. YouTube way better!,negative
Unbelievable I'm a paid monthly customer and all it does is stop playing constantly glitching i have a strong wifi and cell signal so that is not the issue. Definitely will be canceling this garbage.,negative
"The app is good, the only problem I have is all the adds, and there are a few songs that I can't find on here, it's almost like they never existed, but so far I love all the songs I've found!",positive
Unbelievable but super I like very much I impressed thanks lot,positive
"i can't open my account, I can't open Spotify. My premium acc got into waste. Hope you can fix it soon",negative
"Sometimes if you follow a link pn Facebook, it denies you from play the song and other stuff",negative
"Spotify was Great until I learned they are now getting into the ""COVID Disinformation"" game. Putting up warning labels on podcasts which may contain a different opinion than the corporate narrative is entirely weak. The science of COVID is not settled by any means. To discourage differing opinions as to early treatments or vaccine injuries is not only dangerous, but Un-American!",negative
"It just stops playing music and podcast it will work for a song or two or 10 minutes into a podcast then it just stops, play bar is going like you just started the app up, doesn't remember that played a song or where it stopped in song or podcast. Then you have to go back in the app find where you stopped hearing the content. Got full bars, 5G unlimited plan no where near the ramp down limit so it's not that. Pandora and utube music play just fine. Starting to wonder why I pay for this when it",negative
Really appreciate and enjoy the music,positive
i love it!!! very useful and worth it u should try,positive
Has become very glitch lately and nearly unusable Unresponsive with Bluetooth devices and constantly crashes,negative
The app experience in not up to the mark. Animations are not smooth & the app always maintain a dark mode which is not acceptable.,negative
"I love this app so much, no Lag, easy to navigate, and 99% have the music I want",positive
I'm a premium user but when I download songs and set my internet connection off then I can't able to access the songs I downloaded it will automatically restart the downloading when my data connection is on! Please don't waste your money on Spotify Premium Is The Worst App And I Need Refund!,negative
I super love this app! Try getting the premium version (even for just a day) -- it's worth it,positive
Very good app you can listen songs while your phone is off and the sound is very soft and good,positive
I enjoy it vey much.I recommend it to anyone.,positive
"It was good for several years but now i have a problem with premium payment, it always keep retry when i want to pay",negative
"The miniplayer on the app was removed. I can't shuffle, pause/play, repeat or toggle to a section of the song. Awful update.",negative
"Seriously, it works wayyyyy better on my TV. Every time I try to play a certain song... Let's say 'Merry Christmas everyone' for example. If I try to play the song it ends up playing something completely different. I play that song and it starts to play random rave music instead of the one I specifically told it to play. It's very annoying but it doesn't do this on TV though. So many ads as well but I don't want Spotify premium.",negative
So many bugs recently. Pausing music for no reason. No play button. Music just stopping. Not worth paying for to be honest. Really hope they fix this soon,negative
Great music/streaming app. Have used this for years.,positive
Great selection and just what I want,positive
All those months it not work and they have not fix this issue if I play A song it will randomly play a random song please fix this again and the next update ok manager and developer ðŸ˜¤,negative

I like music and this provides a plethora.,positive
"Amezing app for song lovers, you are enjoying to listening the song with the lyrics",positive
The choice of songs are extremely good,positive
I loved listening to music but I can get that from Pandora and many other apps. Unlike you that back lies and promote hate just to make a buck. Spotify is a supporter of all that is bad in this world today. Shame on you. I'm no longer supporting Spotify and your app is being deleted from all of my devices!,negative
"The latest version is a whack,you can't choose a specific liked song to play ðŸ¤¦ I regret updating the app,fix this,and the user interface is annoying. Rating 5stars when fixed",negative
The UI can be confusing. Hard to find things. Overall bad for podcasts.,negative
Constantly crashes on my pixel 6. Has so many bugs where it plays music but I can't pause or stop it.,positive
Great! I am really enjoying this app! Thank you!,positive
I just downloaded Spotify and so far it's great! It allows me to play music while doing something else which I think is helpful in my opinion!,positive
"Awesome app, I love making my own playlists and listening to other people's lists all day and the suggested songs are always on point",positive
LOVE â¤ï¸ my ONLY app for music and podcasts!,positive

This is the best music app in the WORLD! it has all of your songs that you want to listen to and it's free with ads. but you can get a family membership or just a membership so you can listen to all of your songs add free! so what are you waiting for? hop into Spotify for free music today.,positive
"Awesome. Keep on rolling with the songs,thank you",positive
Spotify is a app were u can listen to music but YOU HAVE to have internet or it won't work and it has every music in the world and u can listen to anything u want and you can make playlist for ur friends,negative
App has become unusable. After months of crashing I tried uninstalling/reinstalling and now it won't open at all. Extremely frustrating to pay for a service that I can no longer reliably use on my phone.,negative
Its good if you have premium otherwise you can't pick a song,positive
Fix your UI. This left aligned nonsense is horrid.,negative
"I gave the app three stars cause when ever I try logging back in, it telling me my password is wrong, then I use the login through Gmail and it's saying it expired when I already sent it to my Gmail. Honestly I do enjoy the app and I would give it five stars. But now it just ruined my vibe.",negative
Incredibly varied entertainment for all.,positive
I love this it helps me when times are ruff,positive
"Good quality and user friendly. A long way to go regarding compatibility with certain display units, sharing, and viewing friends liked songs Playlist.",positive
In my Spotify the playing song is not showing,negative
Love the ease of use and the huge choice of albums. Use it on Wi-Fi for tunes on our Harley and our patio. Uses very little battery.,positive
You give sooo many ads...can't even listen to songs peacefully,negative
I never payed attention to Spotify. I didn't realize it is so much more than music. I listen to meditation and positive messages uplifting music etc... love it!,positive
"There usually some type of issue going on. Restarting the app, and restarting the phone, doesn't always work. Maybe it's just me but I've had better luck with other apps with their algorithm for recommending me bands/songs.",negative
"I love that I can get it for free and still create Playlists even though I hate ads it is a small price to pay for being able to use it AND it is very easy to use. I hope they NEVER change that. I play it on my Samsung cell phone, laptop, & Alexa Echo.",positive
The best music app ever,positive
Love the platform. Especially now that the pressure is on and they refuse to cave to the woke mob.,positive
It's just an awesome app.it has everything i would want in an app. Keep up the good work!!,positive
Getting frustrated.....keeps pausing and then plays than pause than plays...thinking about cancelling my subscription,negative
"Overall love this app. Yes I pay for premium, and I won't go back.",positive
Was sceptical that it would provide choices I liked but it's been brilliant for old and modern music of all genres. Worth the Â£9.99/month for the added benefits of moving tunes order around and not being interrupted by ads.,positive
"Last few days spotify has been bugging out, needs a fix. The media player won't show up and the app will randomly stop playing music.",negative
As am a music lover and really fond of Indian classical and romantic music specially sang by Arijit Singh.. who is currently Spotify's most heard artist.. and for this fact I really loved this app .. The Spotify Original can make my all music dreams fulfill... I also love the fact that it not only supports big singers but also supports small singers like us...,positive
"Good range of music, but too many adds",negative
"Lately, I've been using Spotify as my main music app, but I am raged by the fact they removed the ability to replay a single song. Now it replays the entire album. I would highly appreciate that you revert the changes. Thanks!",negative
Enjoy building my Playlist and checking out recommended music.,positive
I managed to play all the kinds of songs i longed for.,positive
"I enjoy this greatly however a update recently or something caused my filter in liked songs to look scrambled and not scroll over aka rock, etc etc looks garbled mess overlapping hopefully it'll be fixed can't even side slide it llke before.",negative
This app is the best app to listen music ðŸŽ¶ But we cant listen music ofline This is a very bad fault .we need to pay to listen songs ofline.,negative
Happy mode,positive
"Crashes every few minutes, you cant even go through a full song without it crashing, incredible amount of ads and little skips force you to buy premium, you can just use some free app and download your own songs. Hard gui to navigate, especially on phone. Would not recommend anyone ever.",negative
Not everyone wants to pay to get rid of ads; they wish they can have free premium for awhile without paying. Ads repeat over & over again. Sometimes if you say no to ads it will ignore & still proceeds.Kids might listen to spotify;They don't want to hear pathetic foul language commercials. Foul language music comes into playlists; They sneak them in between peoples playlist tracks. Noticed they had duplicates of alvin & chipmunks songs; people notice their is more of alvin & chipmunks on youtube,negative
The app hasn't been stable it's been freezing when using Android auto and when just using it to listen through my headphones,negative
If you don't have premium yet then stick to Pandora instead. This app rocks,positive

"What is wrong with spotify lately?? Everytime I leave the tab and come back, the music tab doesn't show when I click a song and the song won't even stop. I have to close the app all the damn time otherwise it's just lagging. It's so annoying ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’",negative
I love these app. But can you add feature like listen songs with friends. It will be great if these happen.,positive
My fav,positive
This app has changed my music experience. Thanks guys!,positive
I like the fact that you can find so much music but there is sooo much to dislike like the fact that I can't choose what to listen to and every thing is shuffled and I can't listen to whatever I want and if I put one music in a playlist to listen to it They add music out of no where its annoying,negative
Best app,positive
its an awesome app with few adds yet Im enjoying using it ,positive
"Dont know since from yesterday my app is crashing continuously, i tried more than 10 times to reinstall and i tried webplayer its working but the app is not working! Please solve this issue spotify.....",negative
"Been using Spotify Premium for many years, and in last month the app has become unusable with glitches. Now Playing disappears, music stops by itself, whole app crashes. I probably have to force quit the app at least 5-6 times a day now. The only thing saving my subscription is grandfathered Hulu bundle -- new users beware and try Tidal, a great service I also used for years until Hulu discount (no longer available).",negative
I love blackpink and BTS and the song but when I play in Spotify platfrom I get it more experience ðŸ¤—â¤ï¸,positive
I think some of the feature that only available on Apple device should also add for us,negative
"Question? How come Spotify isn't paying me for teaching the younger generation about music? Makes sense to me, the less music gets forgotten the better.",negative
"Spotify has everything, even my friends hard-core band from the 80s is in here! And they didn't cave to the Woke Mafia and kept Joe Rogan. Free Speech for everyone!",positive
In my time using Spotify it has only gotten more buggy. Over a year later and my review stands.,negative
App stops playing podcasts after 10min Also playback section and time lapse dooesnt get updated? It needs to be force quit in order to have the correct info in now playing,negative

"Gr8 is all i have to say, theres some ads but that's fine tbh",negative
Awesome app love it to bits...,positive
Too many ads..after every song an adds start playing it's very annoying.... And their it is said that after this as you can enjoy 30 minutes uninterrupted music but it's not true......,negative
Constant glitches and app not responding.,negative
"Worst experience with spotify.. I have been using the app for the last 4 months and im a free user. In recent days, almost a month im getting ad for every one or two song",negative
The best music streaming app. SpotifyðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª,positive
"Always pauses itself, gets stuck on onesong and never changes. I try and try and try to redownload, delete cache etc. It never improves. Does Spotify care about its Android users? It never, ever broke 2 tears ago, why does it do this now? Also app fails to work with sonos. Never connects when you need it to.",negative
It won't let me listen to or pick my Playlist songs anymore I don't know why,negative
"Amazing app, but please give us the ability to use this app fully in horizontal mode. It's very annoying that whenever I select a song, my screen rotates 90 degrees to vertical mode.",negative

"Really good music no breakage, but no bob marley",negative
"Really goodðŸ‘ you can play song when your offline. But, when I played my liked songs, they played other song that I didn't liked.",negative
"Early May update - now it will just randomly switch from one podcast that I have downloaded to one that i listened to months ago that I am now streaming. If you just start a podcast, it immediately shows as played. Every update makes this thing worse. Setting are worthless. Set it to stream only audio if video is available, video plays. Set it to not auto play the next track, it not only auto plays but it then auto aya something not on a playlist. Why does your UI suck so badly?",negative
My Spotify app is closing automatically when I open and playing the song WT should I do now,negative
New update ruined my Spotify! I have used this app for years. I pay for Premium and I download certain Playlists. After the update my playback pauses and I have done all the usual and recommended things. Please fix this or I will have to find another way to play music and podcasts!,negative
Great connection good music great experience,positive
"Good but annoying. How does an app with playlists give 7 ads in a row and still be called a music app? I legit stoped and move to SoundCloud and YT Music. And wth is ""can't skip for 1hr"" what is this? TinderðŸ˜‚? ""Ran outta right swipes wait 6hrs""",negative
"Someone in the review have said this . I'm experiencing a same problem too . Few days ago , everytime I play the music it will auto close and goes to home screen and not be able to played music in my phone, i am frustrated. I've tried to log out log in, uninstalled and install it back nothing able to make it play again. This happens after i updated spotify. PLEASE FIX THIS ðŸ˜­ 1 person found this helpful",negative
After all these years I still can't delete the current song from the playlist that's playing without having to scroll through all songs (1000+) in the playlist to find that one song that's currently playing.,negative
"Shuffle from playlist dosnt work no matter what i do. Liked song ends, new song is a similar from spotify. Cant hear my Liked songs playlist. Can you hel me fix it?...",negative
This app is actually good so far and I'm new I started 2 or 4 days ago and so far it's doing great but there is a issue there is not a speed up button so I can speed it up I would love to speed up the music I'm hearing .the audio is pretty good and if your wondering Spotify let's you listen while offline unlike YouTube music.,positive
I like this app but....when I use it i can't listen a song ðŸ™‚ please fix this and this is good app this help me remember some of my favorite songs I forgotten ðŸ™‚,positive
"I loved Spotify I used to use it all the time, but now when I get a ad for ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" it crashes after the ad or after ONE song I get a dang add.",negative

Good,positive
"really disappointed with the removal of song preview feature in search and suggestion bar for free plan user why took something insignificant for you yet so useful for the users? what's the benefit out of it other than ruining the whole experience I know you guys trying to encourage people to buy premium plan but this is just too much, why can't have a little fun with just a song preview feature?",negative
What you do with our old Spotify Please bring him back,positive
I experience a good day during that I listening my favorite songs of my favorite singerðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—,positive
"I really hate shuffle button, pls add the button of turning on and off shuffle whyyyyyyyyyyy",negative
"When it works its very convenient, but it has far too many bugs for such a widely used app and one I'm spending 17 aud on a month. Certian songs or podcasts will often just not play for no reason when they would before, you sometimes can't access downloads offline because spotify tries to connect the download page to the internet, etc. Extremely annoying",negative
Too many adds,negative
"Love this app. Perfect for listening to my musical playlist whilst relaxing, cycling or walking.",positive
Fix your app or your not getting renewed in May. I pay more than other apps to allow you to use an outdated UI and the short cut bar doesn't load half the time. Premium subscription isn't worth the money. Fix it or lose to others. Your call,negative
Best,positive
"Over all I think it's a very good app I mostly use it wen I am studying and doing homework. I also think it is very good because you can change your listening experience, you can also look at other people's play lists, another feature I use all the time is you can use mixe's with combinations you and your friends liked songs into one playlist. SKIP HERE FOR THE BAD STUFF- The only reason I gave this app a 4 star rating is because of the MAGER amount of ads.",positive
It helps me focus,positive
Absolutely Brilliant ways to enjoy my favourite podcast Joe Rogan. It's good there's a platform where you free to discuss ideas. Plenty of choice and opinion to listen to other things for free,positive
Very best music app in 34 mb I love it,positive
Worst app ever. Service provider music player horrible. Dont bother subscribing some how it's worse when you pay monthly does not matter the device. I rather have my phone open and listen to YouTube for free then pay 15$ for this broken garbage,negative
This is my favorite music share platform~ The interface is easy to use and easy to learn. I highly recommend.:),positive
This is a superb app with premium no other music app can match its interface. Tho Spotify India must reduce the premium monthly cost to 99â‚¹ per month. Tho if it is 119â‚¹ it is still good bang for buck. I love the premium you may like it too.,positive
"(I had I iTunes before, and I wish this app gets as good as iTunes... don't get me wrong I love a few features from this app but it could be better....) That was my previous comment about this app now I'm much more happier than before since you guys introduced the lyrics, I love it so much... thank you guys for listening my advice..",positive
Excellent music quality with some very impressive individuals providing outstanding performances... Thanks Spotify... all the best....,positive

I'm not able to add some song in playlist ðŸ˜žðŸ˜ž,negative
"Free version, not worth it. But premium is way worth it. If you don't plan on paying for premium, don't get it. But if you do plan on getting premium their is no better music service",positive
Great variety. Like having linked to Alexa.,positive
"The last couple of months it has been very glitchy. Every single time I open the app, it says it has updated exactly 49 songs and the app will then stop and cannot download this mysterious last, 50th song. I have to restart my phone. Absolutely painful. Also music playing but no currently playing displaying on the screen, have to go into the app each time. Randomly shuts itself down too. The share function hasn't been working either. Unacceptable for premium subscription. Sort yourselves out",negative
A great music service.,positive
Started to crash anytime I try to play a podcast,negative
"I only have this app to listen to the rogan podcast, CONSTANTLY I'm in the middle of an episode and all of a sudden it stops playing, skips to the next episode and marks the epsiode i was actually listening to as fully played, and i have no idea where i was in the episode when i got kicked out. This has been a problem for several months. It will happen at the same spot, in the same episode evey time, so i have to find that particular spot in the episode and skip past it in order to finish.",negative
verynice apps,positive
This is a pretty great app. There's just a couple problems I can't explain,positive
"I've started getting ads come up 3 seperate times within the past 30 minutes, each having 3-4 ads at a time... This is the free version and Its expected to have ads every now and then but this is excessive.",negative
Some one is using my Spotify! I cannot get him out from Vietnam! I will lose all the music I have 466 songs!No one can help me I have no choice but to DELETE all my songs!,negative
"App worked well for a week, now I can't even play a single song because it won't load when I hit play. This update sucks as bad as the last one did.",negative
You keep removing songs that were available less than a day ago along with being slow and freezing up more when go to the liked songs.,negative
"Probably the best app. I stand corrected, Definitely THE BEST",positive
Amzing jop drapo,positive
"Again, 200 mb for listening to one podcast at home on wifi. Do I need download everything and go offline when at home? Uses a lot of mobile data when at home connected to wifi, have a solid wifi and app settings / permissions have been set up accordingly. Also it became an sudden data burner (gb's) when on the road, again all has been set up correctly and downloaded content as always before leaving home. Please look into it Spotify and fix it!?",negative

Very good and I think everyone can use it,positive
best music app voice quality is melodious,positive
"2 years later, still using this app basically on the daily. You can find anything from UK hits, podcasts, heck, even video game music! Downloading songs are only worth it if you have a lot of phone storage, at least 8gb free. A few minor bugs whilst working with Amazon Alexa and some Samsung Edge extensions, but I'd recommend it overall. 4/5",positive
Great sound quality and easy app to use,positive
"This app actually sucks. I can't even play my playlist, instead I just get some other song I've never even seen before.",negative
Love the app but the fact that the lyrics feature still won't work even if I cleared Cache/data and reinstalled several times is annoying,negative

Why isn't my like songs playlist working??? It's not opening no matter how many times I try.... Please fix it...,negative
I recently uses application and I was not impressed there are better alternatives,negative
The algorithm radio is bad coz it just show you the latest songs you frequently heard.,negative
Would be lost without it. Starting to explore and enjoy the daily mixes more. My playlist is getting longer and longer,negative
I don't listen to music everyday so i can't nitpick tecnical thing about this app m here only to rant about their irritating technique to force us to take the prime membership.....i mean come on man is it mandatory?obvsly no everyone know this .......then why make it sooo annoying by putting an ad after every single song......atleast give us 30min nonstop song as it was before that would be enough for us.... M not stopping u from doing ur advertisement but have lil bit of pity on us......,negative
The variety of music is right in my wheelhouse Great app,positive
When I was so tide. That time Spotify will make me Free felling. Everything Time When i was lesson ðŸ’¯Satisfaction,negative
The app really sucks its so glitchy and takes so long to load anything refuses to download my liked songs and for the quality of the service it is far too expensive but im too lazy to change apps and find all my music again,negative
I love there's so many more options and ways to look for music. I love the way it's set up and the layout is very organized Spotify is awesome. I do pay for the premium cuz I cannot stand commercials and when the music stops.,positive
Do bring the option to sort the playlist...it was present earlier and with the updates it was removed....bring it back it's been very useful,negative
"Crashing constantly, uninstalled and trying again. Crashes when I press the search bar. Also attempting to use SD card to store music is a compleye waste of time, it just doesn't work. If a fix isn't sorted very soon my money goes to Amazon. (Premium)",negative
i have a premium account on Spotify and i did all the updates but i still don't have the lyrics,negative
I would rate it a five but because of the adds being so long I give it a four,negative
I love just having music that I like. I can find music even if I don't know the name of the song or the artist. I can choose my playlists according to my moods. I love that I can follow small artists as well.,positive
"The app is pretty good unless you use it on a phone. If you use it on a computer or a tablet you can skip as much as you want, choose your own songs and skip to any part of the song, but on a phone you cannot do any of that, you only have 6 skips per hour.",positive
"It's easy to use and i can literally search for any song on it, plus it's lyrics are on point.",negative
Great for music and podcasts.,positive

The latest update has left me with no option to skip ahead on the song/POD cast or to select the next song.,negative
"Latest update, can't swipe notification away, have to force close, can't access the bottom of menu's due to player blocking access, no option to hide albums from recently played, playlists set to public as default. Umm no thanks, I will stick with a much older version.",negative
Glitchy. Music keeps playing after pausing. Videos sound plays but the video doesn't appear.,negative
The best app listening to music and product.,positive
It's a great service and app; but the premium subscription is far too expensive and definitely NOT worth the money!! Just time out the adds and put the $13 bucks in your tank and go for a burn ride. Way better option for your money!!,negative
I pay 10 bucks a month to listen to music's that I don't own ad free. I should at least have the ability to listen on multiple devices at one time. What's the hold up on an update like this? Another idea. How about a remove from Playlist option.,negative
Too many ads and not enough money for musicians,negative
Great music and podcast app! I only wish they had different tabs for music and podcasts so I could switch back and forth without losing my place.,positive

Best app for music. I have tried Many famous Apps For online music streaming but Any app didn't Full fill my expectations but Spotify Full fill it and satisfied me But it contains so much ads ! Please reduce the amount of ads in the app .,negative
Where's the Exit button? Keeps running in background. I have to go into settings to Force it to Stop. Or have to clear memory to get rid of it? Rather than that hassle I'm uninstalling it.,negative
Absolutely one of the BEST platforms to experience your favorite songs! Outstanding method to identify new enjoyable music! Love it!!!,positive
Forces offencive and disgusting music into your playlist without permission and has no way to report said music when this happens.,negative
I can reply the same song I want to play and I have to listen to an album of one song I wanna listen to and I got logged out of my account randomly for no reason and it didn't save the account so this app meh it ok ig,negative

I like everything,positive
Definitely recommended for many different people. Need to be a little more about the mood of the day and provide a better selection of sounds for different times of the day for different people. Cherry Laced DMs might help in some cases,positive

"Really only good if you have money Listen, it's a good app when you actually have money. I'll give it that. But when you're unable to pay for a subscription things can get absolutely terrible. I'd be fine with like maybe an ad or two but no, free removes basically everything good about the app. It's terrible, like literally your strategy is making people so mad with the fre version they buy what the actual app should be without money. I'm legitimately considering changing music apps cuz of this",negative
"Hi, I just start using it and till now it is great, thanks",positive
"It is given that this is indeed one of the best app to listen online.. But the problem is when offline.. I downloaded the songs already in order for me to listen to it while i dont have internet (workplace dont have internet). The problem is sometimes may dowloaded songs wont play. Also, the menu to add queue wont work.. Work this out please.. Thanks",negative
"Amazing app! I definitely recommend it! Although there are lots of ads, u will find every single song here!",positive
The music recommendations are good. Quality of app is very poor. Constantly crashes. It always loses your place when you're in the middle of a podcast. Takes such a long time to load saved songs and podcasts. It's frustrating,negative
It is a verstile platform which allows me to engage in a wide range of songs and podcast,positive
A few bugs every now and again. Recently it has been booting me out the app. Bugs usually fixed in good timing.,negative

I have never been disappointed in finding or listening to a broad range of music on Spotify.,positive
"Hello! I'm new to Spotify and this is my first time using it. I'm loving it so far! I just have a few suggestions, 1. In the music player, we should be able to swipe down and up without having to use the arrow. 2. A double tap to seek for about 10 seconds would be really nice to add. 3. In the mini music player, we should be able to swipe down to get rid of it. 4. More animations when you click the pause and play button would make Spotify better. And 5. Sometimes the app will crash after opening",negative
Not just music. Unbelievable podcast selection.,negative
"I'm on premium but not for much longer with these latest changes! The media player bar is gone, can't turn off shuffle, spotify doesn't come up in my phone's status bar when playing anymore, can't get songs off the queue list even by completely closing the app, can't pause music in the app so I'm having to completely close the app. I can't believe they expect people to pay for this with all these horrible changes. I know I won't be for much longer unless they fix all this very quickly!!!!!!!!!!!",negative
"Since the last update, listening to podcasts has been terrible. I deleted the app and installed it again and it's no better. I can't stop or pause a podcast without closing down my phone. A year later, still the same issues off and on.",negative
It adds songs to my playlist that I never wanted on there. And the 30 minutes no ads thing is only about 10.,positive
"Your servers always have a problem with logging me in. So frustrated, whenever I get a new phone, it's so hard to log in again",negative
"The app was all right before, but now it won't show me the 'now playing' bar. That's basically its main feature. Completely removing all storage and cache and reinstalling didn't help so it went from four stars to one for me.",negative
It's awesome and great music app,positive
"Since the latest updates I have lost my playlists that u have created and profile is now all wacked out. Also, I cannot even search for songs by artist as I just get a black screen. Once this has been fixed I can give it a 5 star rating!!",negative
this app is so good i can hear all the songs free,positive
"I can't make a playlist without it adding songs I don't want on said playlist. And then when I try to listen to the playlist, it doesn't even play the songs I added! I turned off everything in the settings, cleared my cache, and still this persists.",negative
"Whenever I connect to my home wifi the app shows no internet available. It's really frustrating, like I'm writing this review using the same wifi but not able to search anything. I can play the songs from my liked playlist which I have not downloaded but cannot search new songs. Don't know what this is but please fix it.",negative
OMG! I LOVE THIS APP! I LOVE THAT YOU MADE THIS APP BETTER! Bcs it had glitches lol:) But now it's so amazing!âœ¨ I can listen to my playlists all night:D I recomandate this app<3,positive
Best app for music.. periot,positive
"Its so trash, I can click on a song, but the song that it plays will be completely different",negative
I love Spotify. It's the best. And I can't live without it. But this recent issue frustrates me a lot. Whenever I play a song from my playlist one song after some other songs starts playing even though shuffle is off. Please look into this and I will come back to give it a 5,positive
"Love the app, I have used it for years but recently the mini player within the has disappeared and no really way to see what's playing,pause or skip tracks and I'm also have the problem of having to close down all apps when disconnecting aux from car because music keeps playing on phone. Spotify is this a bug from recent update or ......?",negative
Best choice for listening music,positive
"The point of paying is being able to listen to your music offline. Every 2 days, my music is unavailable and I have to download it again. ðŸ˜¡",negative
"The app is super glitchy. Currently 1 title is showing of a podcast while other music and podcast are playing, while also not showing a time bar at all for the actual music or podcast playing. The app pauses randomly. The app will also randomly exit entirely. Maybe it's time to go back to pandora or something",negative
Hate the ads,negative
The app is just perfect.,positive
"The latest update is not allowing me to play any song at all, the ads play just fine but the actual music doesn't even start playing when i click on *any* song. my liked songs have disappeared and I can't update any of my playlists either. I have no idea why it's not working and even before the update my liked songs were all gone, i couldn't access any of them for months and i couldn't like any new songs. I couldn't even stream Jimins ost. It's not cute luv, very frustrating",negative
Nothing beats spotify 100% best app out there,positive
Since Spotify has updated its premium features which are playing in loop shuffle rewind etc I have switched to Jio Saavn because it serves the basic services for non premium members and thats perfectly seamless Even I have copied my playlists from Spotify to Jio Saavn I know Spotify team is doing it for business but blocking basic features isnt business,positive
"So many bugs, always crashing. Premium isn't worth it anymore",negative
best app that I currently use compared to all other music apps... I listen to a lot of underground and new artists that are trying to make a name for themselves along with the current podcasts ... I would never use another app again and I have been with Spotify for well over 5 years and use premium which I've never had issues with... ðŸ˜€,positive
Yall are getting rid of the voice feature and I'm disappointed,negative
Nice,positive
They gave me 6months free trial and so far love it,positive
I love how the podcast is being played on it smoothly. Thank you very much,positive
Really like having limited ad's and they don't take up the whole screen.,negative

All of a sudden I keep losing the ability to manage the podcasts I.e. pause or rewind and have to keep logging out and sometimes reinstalling the app to get this working again.,negative
Happy so far!! Good tunes!,positive
Best music app in my opinion. Just wish monthly wasn't so much but what ten bucks every month,negative
"Best music app out there with Spoify premium you get no adds and its so worth it if your someone like me that listens to music all day everyday. Spotify is the best, play anything you want anytime you want.",positive
High quality songs and lyrics,positive
"Very good music player, perhaps the best, but the fact you NEED premium (10 bucks) to turn off shuffle is unnecessary and greedy",negative
Really cool app... It consumes less data and it's just amazing one problem is that buy the premium ad always pops up that is sometimes mood spoiler too.. i would love if that pops up really less other wise whole good app..,negative
"The best music app ,try premium and you will not regret it",positive
Good but too many ads,negative
After the recent update..... Everything just went downhill to be honest from all the bugs,negative
"The ""no playbar"" bug was the last straw for me. I have finally canceled Premium and uninstalled. Spotify is so bad.",negative
"Well I've got 2 things to complain about. 1. There used to be this thing where you srarch up a song and you can listen to a fraction of it, now it's gone. If you wanna make sure its the song u want, or to just browse new songs, u have to play them individually, which makes it very uncomfortable. 2. There's no option to stop the app from playing SUGGESTED songs after it plays some of the playlist's. It's frustrating, becouse most of the suggested songs aren't my type at all.",negative
When I try to resume my 3 month premium it's say something is wrong but there is nothing wrong,positive
Can't even login using Google despite having premium membership. No matter how i try to login via Google it just won't work.,negative
"It's It's amazing, glad I chose tools oflver deezer and all the other platforms, if I had to say something just a few more stats to do with artists or on the wrapped we get yearly!",positive
30 min add brakes are a lie but otherwise good in my opinion,positive

Best music service,positive
"Honestly i use this app too much ðŸ˜‚ but like its so good i can safely say unless u like adds spotify Premium is the way too go, shuffle isnt all that bad tho",positive
"When I first opened the Spotify App, I was a bit sceptical. Then it took me about 30 minutes to get free downloads of music I had spent months trying to find and pay iTunes for. WOW!! I have had Spotify for a few years now, and they have always delivered. Still just have the free account - the ads make it seem less like a great music collection, and more like a great radio station that only plays stuff I like, but I am totally OK with that. Thanks heaps for a fantastic app.",positive
This is the best thing in th world and it has all of the best songs,positive
Very nice aap. Good music app,positive
It could use some work with the recommendations but overall it's a cool app. ðŸ˜Ž,positive
Very good music app every album is there,positive
Data consumption has increased and ad every minute which is not good,negative

Truly amazing and beautiful app. Brings back the beauty of music and pretty good playlists.,positive
A good choice for listening to music but has a ton of issues. From amount of ads to randomly crashing now. It seems the apps going downhill fast but it's still not bad in my opinion.,positive
"I like the app but, since im not a paying user on mobile i dont get to choose to play my own song, other than that i find the app pretty good, though i did wish that specific premium feature could come on free, id understand if its not possible, just writing this as a warning for mobile users downloading this who dont wanna pay for premium, i do listen on my ipad and it works amazingly there so im happy about that, thank you",positive
It's good for music use it almost every day it's confusing how to change plans but it's fine alot of different music and it recommends hood artist from my taste I've told my friends about it I love it easy to work easy to look for music alot of ads if you have standard edition so I would recommend premium,positive
Uhm? What is with the random drop in connection to bluetooth/smart speakers now or it just turning off... that definitely wasn't an issue I had before. Fix that please.,negative
"The app was good for the past 4 days but when i opened the app and try to play my fav songs,i started to wonder why it isn't playing the full song but now i i know...I had to play the shuffle songs which is kinda annoying since i only get 6 skips ðŸ‘ŽðŸ»...This app really is RESTRICTING.",negative
I absolutely love this app. I've chosen who I like and just hit shuffle and let the music just play,positive
"Every time I have used Spotify since November of 2021 is will pause my music every time my phone loads, now since April 10th, it has been pausing randomly, I've tried everything online but it just isn't working. Tell me what is wrong please.",negative
I would give it a 5 but everything I get in my Benz it starts playing on my phone. I wish I could prevent it from playing on my phone. Will have to drop paid version if I can't figure it out.,negative
Great,positive
"Need video, and some music are not found, paid for the premium and still can't see some songs,",negative
Best music streaming app.,positive
It keeps crashing all of a sudden. No play bar now either. What the frik? Spotify is my Dopamine. Please Fix. Thank you.,negative
This is literally the best way to listen to music as long as your willing to pay for premium and would actually use it enough for it to be useful. That being said I've been using it for 7 years and been paying for premium off and on for about 5 and this is 2022.,positive
Good app. Though you probably need to pay for premium to get better usage.,positive
"I'm very thankful to Spotify.... it's so easy to handle and enjoy what you want at that time... Usually, I am not interested to review apps...but, Spotify made a special space on my time â˜ºï¸",positive

"This app is by far the best music app that I have ever used WITHOUT a paid subscriptionðŸ˜±ðŸ˜± I've tried and have paid for about 30 different music applications and NONE of them give the same option as Spotify, the option to create playlists play them nd without a subscription it doesn't limit ur music is still plays all the music u had on ur list but thousands of other artist within the same Genre and for me that is difficult considering I LOVE heavy metal, Alternative, 80s,90s, 00s R&B",positive
"I had to watch 6, 30sec ads just to get 15mins of music",negative
This is getting worse and worse. 6 ads before you play music is ridiculous.,negative
"Happy with the app. Please add a feature in which we can directly ""Add to queue"" an unplayed song, without playing it or adding to playlist & then ""add to queue"". Also, would be more happier if no. of ads is little reduced.",negative
Canceled my premium and they charged me AND when I checked if I even got premium I DIDNT so they stole my money ðŸ˜ unbelievable. But app is good and works great but I'm actually mad about the stealing thing like I had to contact my cashapp n stuff and now im waiting to see if there's something I can do about it,positive
Im a premium customer for years now. Whatever is going on with the app needs to be fixed asap! There is a problem with app for fully actualizing and there's no way to control the music as the widget does not show up. I've tried reinstalling and signing in and out and there's no fix. I dont want to switch to another music vendor. Please fix this!,negative

"Ok ,but needs to be more attractive and user friendly",negative
"Am always surprised at the level of obscurity on this music app; so many obscure, esoteric bands, in lots of different genres. I HATE WHEN IT ""RECOMMENDS"" ME MUSIC, AS IT NEVER HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT I LISTEN TO.",positive
Cancelling my subscription. Going back to peace and quiet.,negative
"After this last update the app won't even open ok my phone, it's just stuck on the loading screen",negative

To much ad's,negative
"Lowered my review from 2 stars to 1. More ads than songs, says no more ads and follows it with 3 more minute long ads. 30 minutes ad free listening plays 1 song then ads. Uninstalling",negative
spotify sessions are great except for the fact the music lags everytime you fix the queue or add a song to the queue. its so annoying please fix that. edit: the one abive still applies but now i have ANOTHER problem. i keep downloading playlist and it shows downloaded but isnt. its like im not even paying for the app lol. fix this.,negative
It's amazing but took me a second to learn how to use most features,negative

It seems to be messing up my Bluetooth connection for other sources. I need to be be able to disable the takeover it seems to want.,negative
"So buggy, especially when switching between listening devices. Now playing does not update to show what's currently playing. Sometimes it keeps playing even after closing the app. And it just randomly crashes for no reason. Album art doesn't load most of the time either",negative
"Been listening to Spotify for a couple years now and the adverts are just a nuisance. What is the point of a song then a minute of ads after each one? Bit of a money grab going on lately, not impressed. Other than that, it's an ok app but going downhill as time goes on.",negative
Despite me having internet connection to literally every other app it says I don't have it for spotify?? This hasn't been a problem for 4 months but has been for the past week. Also 6 skips per hour is dumb.,negative
"Music always cuts in and out like it's a scratched cd playing, so annoying. Pandora or Amazon prime doesn't do that all.",negative
"It used to be a wonderful app and I was about to finish my 1 year usage of this app. Spotify was my favorite, just until they made streaming on other devices PREMIUM. I mean, how can you change a feature's identify of being free or premium after a long time, even after it was free for years! Seriously disappointed with the Spotify company's promise and agreements. Never gonna buy or use this app's features again. I quit Spotify Ltd.!!!",negative
Good but wish it was better the fact that u can't pick the exact song u want to play but u have to wait and the ads are a problem if ur not paying for the premium.,negative
It's clear & the sound is awesome....n fast,positive
Years in and I still love it. Never a problem. So much easier than ANY other app. Love my music and they deliver. Thank you..,positive
"Good ,but that many adds is unnecessary and of recent it keeps glitching on my computer: it plays the first couple of seconds of the song over and over and the layout becomes all messed up (hard to describe).However it is a great app if you want free music and premium isn't necessary even if you do have to deal with all the adds and not being able to listen without WiFi.",positive
Good music but I can't stream music through data so only downloaded music while on the road :(( didn't have that the past couple years,negative
"The music choices are great, but look. Spotify took money out of my bank account to pay for premium, which is fine by me it means less time messing around. But they took money, and didn't give me my premium. My app is not working, none of my music is showing up and despite me constantly having WiFi it doesn't recognize my connection.",negative
"I've been enjoying spotify. Since I've got spotify, the interface, the music playlist, just everything has been great. I have a google home and pairing and using it for music is seamless, It automatically syncs with all my devices. Turn off my laptop and pick right back up on my phone. I recommend even the free version is worth it. Trust me, you won't regret subscribing to Spotify.",positive
Love this app any song group you are looking for ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚,positive
Must include the option of voice search.,negative
"Absolute garbage for podcasts.. When u add an episode to a playlist, it kicks you all the way back to episode one.. When you are dealing with audiobooks that are over 100 episodes this is a royal pain in the posterior.. Unintsalled",negative

The game is good but if i play my song its not the song i wanted but the app is still goodðŸ˜,positive
Thanks to the most recent update Spotify is now PERFECT. I can now clear the app and the music will still play! Also if I clear all my apps then connect my phone to my cars Blu tooth the music will start without me having to re open the app! This was my only complaint about the app before and now it's perfect! 1000/10 would recommend.,positive
This is truly a good app. However spotify it is glitching and once it finishes a song it won't automatically play the next one also I can't see what my friends are playing anymore. However definitely recommend this app,positive

Getting in contact with customer service is way harder than it needs to be and the app keeps starting my music in the middle of the tracks,negative
"Been using it for over a year now, very good but new update pretty much disables the whole concept of the playlist. Before you could just add songs and normally listen to them, but noe they add you more songs which you are not able to remove for no real reason, and even that doesnt do anythign because youll just be given a completely random song afterwards. It sucks reall and also whats up with only 6 skips per hour, thats just dumb",negative

"If we're talking about the phone app, it's a bummer. It's hard to use and most of the times it doesn't even play the songs I chose to play. I don't hate Spotify itself, because the application in my laptop works perfectly fine. I just wished it was easier to manage.",negative

I love it because I can enjoy a variety of music including complete albums.,positive
"Improved by one star, as some connection issues have been addressed. However in the latest versions casting just simply does not work! SPOTIFY CONNECT DOES NOT WORK! In addition now chromecast does not work!",negative
"I really like the app but I hate the current one, I hate that it automatically shuffles your playlist and when you wanna listen to a single song it plays other songs than the song you wanna hear. spotify on desktop is better but I can't listen to the desktop spotify because my pc is broken. can you please remove it so we can choose between normal, repeat and shuffle.",negative
I like it because it has lyrics accompanying the song.,positive
This is good,positive
I'm able to find multiple genre of music and listen to my fav artists,positive

Nice listening to wonderful music!,positive
Its really nice to listen to music without not being able to leave the app,positive
"Until now the app was ok. I learned how to use totally chaotic interface. But after upgrade developers managed to break the app. It is unstable, it will not load lyrics while playing on external device (Rpi) and you cannot close notification when it is not playing. I want to enjoy music without being annoyed by terrible app.",negative
Great music and sound,positive
Spotify has been a really helpful platform where I can stream music for absolutely free!! The quality is top notch and every song in the world can be found on this app. You can even listen to your friends playlists and have a great time listening to your favourite music. Premium definitely unlocks a new world. 100% recommended app.,positive
Hiding podcast removes it from home screen only for 90 days! That should be permanent,negative
Love the selection and genres,positive

At frst i like the app but after a few days i got really really frustrated by the ads. They came back to back for 30s and then i realised that my patience level is very low. And even the top charts are not updated....,negative
It's awesome and I love the interface very easy to use.,positive
Full of ads,negative
"Okay, I get this app needs revenue to keep their app running. BUT THE ADS ARE MORE INSANE THAN THE PAST FEW YEARS. This app lets me listen to 2 or 3 songs, then gives me 5 or 6 ads that are at least 15-30 seconds. This is insanity. And then they just beg you for Spotify premium, which isn't even worth it. All it does is remove the ads and it charges you like 10 dollars a month for it. This app was at it's finest a few years ago but now it's just shreds of a broken memory. 2 stars until fixed.",negative
"Spotify is great however since this new update.....when I get out of the car and turn the car off, my Spotify on the phone instantly turns on and I'm unable to turn the music off. I have to turn the whole phone off!!! Pretty annoying....can you sort it out?",negative
Sometimes the songs dont stop even if I want to.,positive
"Awful awful upgrade!! ðŸ˜­ I have Spotify premium and following the update, I can no longer see the name of songs playing at the bottom or have the option to stop, pause, skip, play, see lyrics. What is the point! It's awful! Please revert back. Or explain to me how I can revert back to the old version.",negative
"Too many ads. Edit: Now the ads are increased. Deleting right away. But if I had taken premium, the app would have been awesome, I know. So if anyone reading this, if you're ready to pay, then I recommend this app!",positive
"I've only just started using it, but it's so much better than Amazon music. It has a wider range of music and it's world music library is amazing. I even found an album by my old music teacher Luis Morais from Cabo Verde. Check him out, you won't be disappointed.",positive
OK,positive
Super buggy update. Music stops playing randomly. 'Now playing' bar disappears randomly making playback control impossible. Need to force close the app and reopen it to get playback controls back.,negative

Amazing experience but too adds,positive
I listen to my son Mobbo Rawbo and the cool thing as his music continues to play in the algarythem and he receives compensation for his music neverending runs.. Cool.. very cool... Mom...... It is a really excellent app... Very very good... better playing on Spotify than anyother.. Ytube is Ytube... but Spotify is special just the way it is set up and I don't mind paying any type of monthly fee or whatever.. Ya know what I mean.. thank you Spotify for bringing my son's music to me and the world!,positive
"This version is real challenging. Podcasts and music keep fading out and maybe restarting maybe not. Of course, offline listening did not work on last flight. I wonder why I am paying for premium. I am listening to a lot of ads on podcasts. Hopefully next release works after get to spend another hour going through grief reload cycle.",negative
Latest version is broken. Currently playing music constantly disappears and prevents pausing or scrubbing without closing and reopening the app. Embarrassing lack of QA this could be found in 5 minutes.,negative
I like Spotify it's great ðŸ‘ music app,positive
I must say this app is the Best thus far & ever FR ðŸ™ŒðŸ¾ thank you guys so much for all the hard work you guys put in it!!!,positive
I really like this app. I can find any music I look for.,positive
This is the best app to listen musin,positive
Good,positive
"Love the app, but I have a small question. When I look for widgets, you have two-one green, one red. Doesn't matter which one I choose, I always get the original (green) widget. Any reason for this? Not a problem, just curiosity.",negative
"Fix this ""no internet connection"" rubbish..Or i'ld have cancel my subscription and switch to another music app that won't give me troubles...Its becoming annoying! i uninstalled and installed..Now i can't even log in to my account anymore..keeps showing ""you're offline"" ""check your connection and try again""..",negative
Crystal clear sound! I can hear every detail of the music! Love it! ðŸ’ž,positive
"Spotify was a bit better before we weren't aloud to loop songs or play them as they are instead of having to play them on shuffled playlists. Its still great, but could be better again.",negative
"So many glitches. It just stops playing very frequently while streaming, even with a strong wifi signal. Often when I'm out of cell and wifi range, the songs in the playlists I have downloaded on my phone will be greyed out, so I can't listen until I get home. I spend a lot of time away from internet service, do this is a pain. Very frustrating. And of course there is the fact that they can't seem to figure out how to make a good podcast player. I'm still paying for something that doesn't work.",negative
"2022 and still no option to add a song to several playlists at once. I've been messaging them via Instagram, even wrote to the support via E-Mail and so on. I've been a Spotify premium customer for years now and this problem stands to this day. Really frustrating to be honest. Other than that the app is obviously alright and I am enjoying the service a lot. Low rating in hope to finally gain some attention...",negative
Very pleased as do family subscription just bit expensive,positive
"Bad controls, cant even turn off shuffle, cant turn on repeat, cant even play a song. whats next pay premium just to open the app. You just wanted money, you didnt care about the community, you just milk for bucks and heartless",negative
"I find it difficult to find old podcast. I wish I could just type in a name and all interviews, across all podcasts would appear.",negative
ADS TO MANY ADS AND STOP ADDING SONG TO MY PLAYLIST,negative
Seriously... Where is the sort option? First you remove the playlist song order editing option. Now we can't even sort songs in album or artist order. change that and it'll be better,negative
"YT Music has clear and distinct quality of base and clarity of voice unlike spotify. On the other hand, I appreciate spotify if i have podcast to look listen and there are more variety of music. But I'll prefer listening to YT Music.",positive
I love this app ,positive
This app so bad. I hate your new update now because I can't listen to music what I want. Like I don't wanna waste my money into app. Like why would you force to pay a premium so that he/she can listen to any music like what. This app is like genshin impact. I recommend not to download this if you don't want to pay any. I will take back my words and rates. if you give free audacity to turn off n on the shuffle. THANK YOU ðŸ˜Š,negative
Great MUSIC 24/7 ALL THE MUSIC YOU WANT,positive

Great way to listen to all my favorites for the 90's and 2000's.,positive
"I have been using Spotify for the better part of 10 years and I have never had any problems until now. Sometimes I'll hit play on a playlist and nothing will happen, and when I finally get it to play, the music cuts off for no reason and I have to start the process all over again. I have never thought of going outside Spotify for music services but that may be what I have to do if these bugs don't get fixed.",negative
"Pretty good, I just don't like the ad system but its good with them",positive
Gut,positive
You can listen to music while turning off your phone ðŸ‘,positive
I love Spotify but it just has adds and I prefer to listen to music than listen to ads all day,positive
Great app to use weather it's on the go or at home doing chores.,positive
"Spotify - how are we meant to control songs (skip, pause, stop, etc) when we can no longer access ""currently playing""? Would seem a fundamental flaw to me.",negative
I am listening to spotify every time! Is perfect for people who loves music,positive
Best app ever,positive
Too many interruptions while listening to the music,negative
"Pretty good music app with so much variety it's hard to choose which songs you would want on which playlist. Had a little hard time getting used to it but now I use it for my walks or when I do chores! If you don't have a radio, spotify is definetly the next best option",positive
"Lagging,not showing songs lyrics",negative
"When I want to listen to a song that I liked, it randomly starts an another song that I don't even know. It's literally so annoying, I want to listen to MY liked songs, not to random songs.",negative
Too many ads. Not able to enjoy the songs...too many ads are coming when compared to other apps..Please reduce the frequency of playing Ads.,negative
I love it because I can hear different music,positive
"App has a a flaw and a bug. Flaw: when listening to a podcast and Spotify gets turned off and let's say a couple hours goes by and it's forgotten what you were listening too. Well good luck finding it again unless you added to to a list in advance. I've had to create a listened-too list for this. Not an issue for music, because whatever, but for podcasts this is a huge goof. I should be able to see on one screen the last 100 podcasts I've listened too. Bug: it stops playing. No reason.",negative
Lately been having issues. Sometimes music crashes. Sometimes the Spotify app plays music but won't show controla. I will update review after issues have been fixed,negative
The app isnt opening stating that there is a bug preventing it from opening.,negative
The best of all the music streaming apps,positive
I love this system.. but the last update really sucks...,negative
"terrible. i searched for a song, but it gives me a playlist that none of the song i like. dont even bother to download",negative
new update bugged. mini player disappearing and not working.,negative
Way too many ads!! Like stop at least let us listen two songs peacefully!! Y'all literally drop the ads after every song.,negative
I LOVE SPOTIFY I LOVE ALL THE MUSIC ON SPOTIFY THE MUSIC ON SPOTIFY FOR THOSE OF THAT DON'T HAVE SPOTIFY I SUGGEST TO ALL OF YOU TO INSTALL SPOTIFY FOR THOSE OF THAT CAN INSTALL SPOTIFY AND FOR THOSE OF THAT DON'T HAVE SPOTIFY GO TO YOUR GOOGLE PLAY STORE AND THEN GO THE SEARCH BAR BAR UP THE TOP OF GOOGLE PLAY STORE AND TYPE IN SPOTIFY BECAUSE I SUGGEST TO ALL OF YOU THAT SPOTIFY IS REALLY AWESOME SPOTIFY IS REALLY COOL SO FOR THOSE OF THAT DON'T HAVE SPOTIFY ALL OF YOU PLEASE DOWNLOAD SPOTIFY,positive
I am not able to use spotify,negative
"I have had a very good time having Spotify so far, the only thing that bugs me is that I really want the ad-supported 0.99 cents a month subscription, but, it isn't on the subscription tab, which sucks. But overall, really good!",positive
Really easy to make playlist ðŸ˜,positive
That app is fine. Except when you click on the video to get 30 mins free of ads but then 10 mins later you get 3 ads in a row.,negative
Great just can you put more base to the songs,positive
"This is an amazing app to listen to endless ads... only problem is , it sometimes play music interrupting your ad...but don't worry, that only happens once in a blue moon.",positive
Queueing issue. Connection issue - both bluetooth and casting.,negative
Great way to listen to all your favourite music. Whenever I drive I listen via Android Auto.,positive
Long time user. These ads are killing everything. I just sat through over 6 ads in a row. Ridiculous!!!!Â°,negative
I've stopped using the app. I am sick and tired of the app deciding which songs to play in my playlist. It keeps wanting to play the same songs over and over.,negative
Have to re download again as I try to play one album but after first song is done it plays a completely different mix. Not the first time and it's painful every time as I have to re download all of the songs I want to hear in low reception areas,negative
"Best ever, i really loved it! There have many song and you guys can play your favorite song at here! Enjoy!",positive
The app is kinda an advertising app not for songs. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ™‚,negative

"There is an issue in the app, when I try to add songs, I wanted to hear the sample, but it doesn't let me. Please fix it, thank you.",negative
"Even using it free it was great. Now that I've subscribed, it is even better. It also works pretty well with my Galaxy 4 watch.",positive
"Very bad recommendation engine, never suggests something new. Just picks songs from the favourites.",negative
I love this app! I love the collab playlist feature too. I think somthing that could be added to make it even better would be a way to replay a certain part of a song. I know some people just want to hear a certain part of a song over and over. Maybe hit a button on the menu when you look at a song and adjust the sides of the time bar to decide what portion of the song you wanna hear on loop. I love this app and I go to youtube when I want to hear a part of a song on loop.,positive
"I can hear the song playing but can't see it, so I can't drag the slider or see lyrics or look at the queue since that happens from the current song page. Latest Android version as of 13th Apr 2022. Samsung S21 Ultra",negative
This app is good but fixe it i can't sign in,negative
Easy app for seniors,negative
"This is the best app to have if you love music, pocascts and other stuff. I have premim and with it I can download all of my playlists, I have unlimited skips, and I don't have to listen to annoying adds. It it awesome.",positive
"Well, spotify is good but one of the stuff just gets on my nerves. The problem that I have with it is that I can't even fine the damn shuffle button and sorry for using the word damn but it's the baby who keeps crying which makes me annoyed. But I can't seem to find it and I want to have my songs play in order.",negative
Spotify was good.....until..... They stop putting your song that was in your playlist well I don't know if it's only me or....,negative

Can you fix the app but i updated to one ui 4.0 is ok is to litsen i like ot really cool IS BLACK DESGIN I LOVE THAT! (â‰¡^âˆ‡^â‰¡),positive
Worst chrome book app that exists. It keeps shutting down by itself. Uninstalling and then installing again does not work! Fix this please!,negative
overall great but it has this bug that even if you are on the best netweok this app will show you that you are offline and really kills the mood,negative
I have enjoyed using Spotify.,positive
Was good. Started getting glitchy over last couple of months until it stopped working. Despite reinstalling ap. will change to someting else.,negative
It is very useful to open sangs while doing other work,positive
"one word, Fantastic.",positive
"Great, get subscription worth it.",positive
Some song are not available . So I want search in another app for the song it makes irretated us,negative
Love Spotify and the endless music genre choices,negative
It's ok but the ads every 30 min without premium kind of suck and should be moved to every 40 to an hour but other than that it's very good,positive
Very good ,positive
Truly amazing! Trust me make the playlist from the pc or tablet,positive
Good Very good,positive
Great and easy app,positive
Excellent app. Music to suit everyone and every mood or event. Love it.,positive
"I love this app. It has its flaws I wont lie. Like the fact that for the last month, my downloads wouldn't play in offline mode. But overall. I love it.",positive
Love it no way to describe it perfect,positive
Great selection. Better price than others,positive
"Uninstalled. Loved it, used to be great, but now pushes to connect to other devices all the time and Bluetooth when those options are turned off. Randomly closes out, ads keep increasing. Sorry, I'm out.",negative
Is fast but the playlist update is the problem,negative
"For the little effect it will have, Im putting a one star rating as long as spotify keeps censoring content. If it keeps up after this drama with spotify and content cools off...itll be time to pull out the ol' mp3 player.",negative
Best app for music by far and for podcasts! Love it!,positive
You want to add a random music button for them who dont want to search and you can play there top song from 1-100.,negative
My experience when it comes to using this app is truly ineffable. A huge shoutout to the developers of Spotify for coming up with such an amazing app.,positive
Best for listening music/podcasts.... The recommendation it gives is next level no other app or website can do it like the Spotify does,positive
"I love listening to music (I use it as a coping mechanism), so I love Spotify so much too. But, about 3 days ago (?), my Spotify wouldn't load, it would just stay on the spotify logo screen thing. Tried installing it and uninstalling it for 5 times, restarted my phone 2 times, cleared the cache/data for about 8 times, and I still can't open it (also waited for an hour for it to load).",negative
took money twice but didnt give premium(chutiya app),negative
Used this since 2017 and it gets used every single day Live the podcasts and the ability to just go anywhere Premium is deffinetly worth the price based on useage,positive
Spotify is amazing music platform.,positive
More songs from anime shows with translated lyrics please also add a download feature to store your playlists I can't do it on the computer,negative
"Spotify, whatever your most recent update achieved, it's not effective. The controls for music/podcast are gone and it keeps pausing on its own. For this amount of $$ a month for a shared account you are certainly on your way to losing subscribers",negative
"Best experience ever! Spotify do not give into the woke, cancel culture. As long as you keep Joe Rogans pod cast on then I will always support Spotify.",positive
This is the best i have ever seen,positive
"This is the best music app, I can but my own music on it and it's just so good that I became a person that listen to music 24/7 but yeah 5/5",positive
i love it because i can use premium for free on this nokio 3310 phone,positive
"Premium user here this app is starting to suck playing when not open constantly crashing other platforms have all u have and more I like Spotify but if this continues I'm gone ,Please fix for both our sakes I don't want to start over again",negative
They want just your money ...We can't skip musics more than 6times,negative
Lately it's glitching and will just cut off when other apps are on. And now the volume is randomly going up and down ðŸ™„ guess I need to switch to pandora. That sucks,negative
Really good app. I would be grateful to have a possibility to listen podcast in loop,positive
"During the birthing throes of the interweb, their was a music algorithym that would tantalize the soul with sounds close to your liking based on the least prompting frim the user. Alas, as moon landing equipment has also become too complex for this now, 126 years later, an arcane and worfully incompetent modern technology couldnt dare venture a decent musical guess. At $13.99. A month. Jesus its trash.",negative
"Last I checked I was in the upper 10% of Spotify listeners, so. Clearly I use this app a lot. I'd call it the best music streaming service on the market currently.",positive
Good job Spotify. You bee spot on.,positive
Umm.. Alright I really love this app it consist of all the songs of the world ðŸŒðŸŒŽ ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ˜˜ must download,positive

Great Playlist an affordable prices,positive
"i love spotify but, its only good good if you have premium otherwise its hard to find the exact song your looking for",positive
"Changed my rating from 5 stars because the most recently update has totally screwed up the app. Doesn't show the music actually playing so I can't pause or skip, and doesn't show in my notification tab either. I have to close down the whole app and open back up again. Sometimes it just crashes altogether. What am I paying Â£10 a month for?",negative
"Little glitchy with the last update on S22 Ultra, but always a great app. Usually gets fixed with the next patch pretty quickly. Appreciate them always adding new features.",positive
Awesome app for music,positive
Extremely huge fan of Spotify. The local music that I can't believe I can stream and download is out of this world. Only complaint I have is the algorithms it uses to generate shuffle play I think having options of what could be added or not be added or frequency of songs to repeat would be wonderful. Being able to add two songs together to always be played back to back even during shuffle play would be a great option A lot of artists will make two songs that are actually one long song,positive
"If you are seeing my review spotify makers,Please fix that problem,your ads is too much annoying and iritating the ads comes after every 2 songs which is very very annoying please fix that problem PLEASEðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ That's why I'm giving 4 stars",negative
"I took the premium and looks like it's the best thing to do but it's a bit costly for just listening to music. Also the recommendation of Spotify is so good so far , it's even better than apple music which is actually great. However there should be a option to download only one song instead of downloading whole playlists.",positive
No luck. Paid for dual use and continues as a free service.,negative
"1/5, ever since I updated this app and opened it, it says I don't have internet connection even tho i have internet connection. I tried searching some popular songs it was loading. I had strong signal, but ofc it would still load.",negative
It was fine until the most recent update. Now it's slow and won't let me listen offline unless I manually switch off my data and change the in app settings.,negative
"It doesnt let me play the song i want , it just shuffles to a diffrent sobg please change this.",negative
"Although a bother to buy prem, still no other music app scratches spotify",negative
Overall the app is really great to say its free I give 5 stars because although you have to buy the premium to skip through as many songs as you like and if you want to listen to songs in any order you get 6 skips per hour anyway without the premium Would definitely recommend,positive
"I chose student plan for premium, after entering the details I got ""verification complete"" ,nothing further. My plan did not changed, still ""free"" , after I tried to do verification again I get the phrase "" you already redeemed this offer , AND I'M STILL WITH FREE PLAN...",negative
This is very good app Spotify hindi song telugu tamil wow,positive

Very nice app but please return the enhance button for liked songs,positive
It won't let me pay the whole song in my liked songs area,negative
I enjoyed ðŸ˜‰ listening to you Spotify especially my favorite ðŸŽ¶ music as well as the musicians and the band...,positive
"the ads are kinda annoying, but its good :)",positive
"The most recent update has the app not functioning properly. Randomly stops playing,continues to play after disconnecting from a bluetooth device.",negative
This app is so Good no issues and no any problem. Thatas why is like this app,positive
Whenever I download and log in.. it was showing me no playlist wast their go to home to find some.. if I go to home page.. still every album there seems was empty.. with same matter like go to home page.. not got 1 song to be played.. vry dissatisfied,negative
Personally I think this app is way better than pandora. Been using Spotify for over two years and the range of music just seems to get better and better. So thank you for creating it. ðŸ‘Œ,positive
Its a good app ive been using for many years. I even got premium a little while back. But a bit more recently. It dosnt show the curently playing songs at the top of my screen anymore. Like if i have my phone off it dosnt show on the lock screen the song thats playing. Ive tried looking in my settings but cant find anthing. If anyone knows how to fix that would be great!,negative
"Since I canceled Spotify (hey, everyone, Napster is cheaper and pays artists better!), I've been sleeping like a baby. I'm pretty sure if I had cancer, cancelling Spotify would cure it. That medical misinformation is okay, per Spotify, as evidenced by the fact they're totally cool with COVID lies and blatant racists on Rogan's hate filled turdcast! Also, pay the artists, you soulless diarrhea splatter of a company.",negative
The shuffle absolutely sucks. It is not random at all and frequently repeats songs despite not being on repeat. Would be a higher rating if they had an actual shuffle and not a shuffle based on their algorithm that repeats the same 20 songs,negative
Since i do ay monthly please stop with the offers and adverts. All is good besides.,positive
Please fix the problems ðŸ˜­ Im a paying user and the 'now playing' is gone. And every once in a while the music randomly stops.,negative
"I love the range of music on Spotify, the sound is better than other apps",positive
"Very good app, but please bring back song previews. It helps people know if the song will interest them or not.",positive
Love the accessibility to all music,positive
Really buggy on Samsung galaxy S21 fe we lose all media control after a while and no way to stop songs unless I force close the app the customer care gave me a vague reply asking me to contact Samsung to fix an issue,negative
I mean sure it's alright yk easy to use ads are annoying tho,negative
App going downhill recently. Too many bugs in S22 Ultra. Notification shade gone. When it's there the buttons don't work. Doesn't even show the right song. Will play music and need to be force closed... Now playing panel is gone from the bottom of the app when browsing music etc. No bueno...,negative
I am enjoying the music and it's such a wide variety.,positive
"In this version, the player controls are always disappearing, requiring me to force quit the app and restart it in order to even stop playback.",negative
"Spotify had excellent music something you hear all day anytime. I need to cancel the subscription, I don't mind listening commercials psych radio station thank you.",positive
"better than Apple music, but it's a bit annoying that it gets you used to premium for the starting month, and then you're stuck with shuffle mode forever unless you purchase premium. other than that 10/10 edit: bro stop giving me three ads! im so done! and two of the ads are back to back the same thing. taking a star back",negative
 sure App I rate it 101 best app in Play store,positive
After the update there are more bugs! Click to listen to a song and the song is playing but there is no bar to show the song/skip/pause etc.,negative
Spotify's shuffle will have you listening to the same 7 songs in a playlist of over 100 songs.,negative
Everytime I make a playlist with songs I want to listen to. Spotify randomly adds songs to MY playlist that I don't want to listen to. It doesn't let you skip the songs or take them off the playlist which is stupid. Fix yourself spotify this is why soundcloud Is better,negative
App has been very very buggy lately,negative
It's amazing I like the music and the videos,positive
I gat everything i need right on spotify..,negative
The app has been really glitchy lately never had problems with it not changing from my Bluetooth and not turning of when going out of app,positive
The one thing I like most about this app is it have all the songs â™¥ï¸ðŸ‘ðŸ»,positive
"Hi, after the recently updates, the app become unstable, and return message ""something goes wrong"" or ""Spotify is trying play"". The music and podcasts start to play only at wi-fi network, with our phones doesn't play neither 4g nor 3g. I try uninstall the app, but even to login with at these network takes long times. Them I try to listen FM local rÃ¡dios, I didn't remember that FM radios still existing ahahhahaha.",negative
Great,positive
Very good service if you ever need help they will do their best as fast as they can. Easy to use and premium is worth it,positive
CUTER,positive
Its just the pest you can listen to songs offline,negative
"The default music app. This newest update makes it incredibly laggy, especially on startup and when scrolling through large playlists. Update: I now have to relaunch the app twice every time for it to work properly. Every update seems to make the app worse",negative
I love spotify it's like my new life partner. I can't live without it anymore,positive
excellent wonderfully broad base of music,positive
Deleting this app.. Bcz I dont listen to songs what I listen are advertisements and not 1 or 2 its 5 at a time.... I gave it 5 star as a gift and switching spotify to gaana atleast they made me hear songs,negative
Bekaar app ,positive
Promotes misinformation. Never worked on my phone anyway and customer support couldn't ever help. Not worth it even more so now because of misinformation. I'll support my favorite artists on YouTube or Apple.,negative
Amazing,positive
It was awesome ver good for music,positive
"Something really frustrating that happens almost every time, when I'm listening to Spotify on my PC my mobile phone automatically becomes a remote control, without me evem having Spotify open on it in the first place. The worst thing is when I want to raise the volume on my phone and instead of raising my phone volume I raise the Spotify volume ON THE PC. Please find a solution for this because this has really become infuriating.",negative
"I really love this app and it has the best collection of music and i am seriously loving it. It lost two stars from me because of the internet issues the mobile app has. The mobile app refuses to work on wifi, the app's search will only work if I switch on my mobile data and switch off my wifi whereas this problem is not there on the desktop app. I would love this app better if this problem was solved.",positive
"I wish Spotify didn't constantly show up in my Samsung phone notification screen. No other app has this behavior. Every time I go to my notification screen, Spotify is there showing a play bar and the last song that was played. I've tried a bunch of different things (including turning notifications completely off in the Spotify app settings) but it always appears.",negative
"All songs and even ads only play for a second before it pauses. I have a strong connection, and video streams fine in HD in other apps just fine. This is garbage.",negative
"Pretty good, although I wish I could listen to a specific song on a playlist without having to shuffle-skip to it!",positive
When it come to music I really love to use this application very much good ðŸ‘,positive
Love life story,positive
I have Spotify Plus because I'm in highschool so I can't have Student and I'm broke so I can't use Premium and pay $10 every month so Plus is great. What I don't like about Plus is the fact that I can't skip ads on my Google TV sometimes and the fact that my Google Home still treats it like the free tier. So that sucks. But literally everything else is fire. I love it.,positive
"App won't load downloaded music without internet connection. Queue system is designed poorly. My upcoming music is a ""playlist"" with a ""queue"" nested in it? So I add a song to play next (starting a queue) but once the song is over it disappears. If I hit back it plays the song from before the one I added specifically. Garbage.",negative
I cant log in even with the correct pass and email it shows network error try again later happened everytime i switch device which made me end up making new accounts and have to do this time too my all songs are gone overall the app is really good,positive
"The BEST music streaming service EVER!!! I use it every single day, and don't know what I'd do without Spotify.",positive
Hope you could higher the playlist capacity. Can't really enjoy my main playlist since I can't add more songs.,negative
"Minuplitive. I hate to do this. I listen to this app for a very long time and I use to love it. I enjoyed this app. Every music I like, they have. Then, I had surgery and struggled with money. I had to stop paying and it was going to be temporary. Well, normally when you stop paying, it auto drops to the free version. Not spotify. Everytime I got on, I was harrassed about resigning up. There was no way to just say dont ask me again. They asked me everytime I got on. For a month. Stop paying",positive
Love Spotify! Have had it for years!,positive
"Awful app and user experience. App constantly deletes my downloaded music (this has been an issue for about a decade as you'll see from googling), says I'm in offline mode when I'm not and thus won't let me search for music, won't let me play downloaded music that it hasn't yet deleted, takes about 5 seconds to load downloaded music, etc. Constantly plagued with issues no matter what device I use (I've tried it on 3 smart phones and 3 desktops). Your developers need to get a grip and wake up.",negative
How many millions of dollars before they can make an app not full of faults? I've seen apps spun up in a few days for something far more niche and low budget perform better than this. A disgrace.,negative
I listen to this app at least 11 hours a day I love it,positive
"I don't need a playlist for my dog, I need the app to not crash constantly.",negative
"Great app,if possible please add sleep timer .",positive
"Horrible creators. The old interface was amazing, and it downgraded so much because of the creators' incompentence and greedines. Want to listen to a song? You can't. Wait for 100 songs to play before you get to it. Have 50 ads in between too. DON'T download this garbage. The only thing it's good for is being compared to better music apps. I'd give it a 0/10 if I could.",negative
Always can find something great to listen to!,positive
It's a good music app and it has most of the music thar I have. Spotify also has it so you can listen to gaming videos(well idk if that's actually a thing I'm just trying to help out the app) the app is great.,positive
Imagine downloading music and podcasts and not having access to them without an internet connection. Thats how smart the developers of this app are.,positive
"I have been using Spotify Family Premium for about 3 years now, even if i wouldn't have premium i would still listen to Spotify Every. Single. Day. The app is the best app for listening music and podcasts (Audio books too but they are a little bit more rare) The app gives song suggestions which usually hit me deeply and whould find my favorite songs that way. 500 Characters aren't enough to show my thanks to the creators and the team that keeps the best App in the world Alive. C:",positive
The best for listening music and podcasts.,positive
I loved it until the recent update. Why did you take off the snippet.,positive
"Despite having spotify premium my home page always has a banner ad for some podcast episode with some celebrity in it yhat I could not care less about at least when there was a ""not interested"" button that didn't work it gave me the illusion of control but now there isn't even that. Thanks for having baked in ads. Also thanks for being to sure to not have any ability at all to say ""I know I don't like this so stop showing it to me"", epsecially in the context of podcasts.",negative
"Spotify keeps cutting out when i pass a free Wi-Fi area, even though i am only playing my downloaded songs. It won't restart unless i open up the app again. I've tried re-installing the app but it still does it.",negative
"My app comes on randomly. No, its the alarm system. How can I stop it?",negative
"Too many add for a free account even! Other musical apps which offer free listening and streaming does not have so many adds. You should have not kept the option of a free app if you wont even let people' listen to 2 songs at a stretch. Also the prices are too high for prem accounts. Nobody's gonna buy when there are better options like wynk, amazon music",negative
Still a solid choice for music,positive
Love me some Spotify it's great music great recommendations for great music ðŸŽµ an it's jus the best I love it!â™¥ï¸,positive

Pretty bad almost unusable... Podcasts cant play.,negative
"Lovw it BUT PLEASE fix the fact that when you add a song to your liked songs it won't change to a green heart most of the time and when you press again it doesn't remove from liked. It stays empty and keeps saying ""added to liked songs"".",positive
The app is good but the ads are annoying,negative
Very functional app backed by great catalogue,positive
Randomly exits app and freezes with paid version. You have to go into settings and force stop the app. Only came here for JRE content.,negative
Lots of bugs on Samsung Note 20 ultra,negative
Great way to hear your favorite music,positive
Love the way you can add different playlists. definitely a good music app.,positive
Way too many ads. Very very limited skips. Basically they do every possible annoying interruptions to get you to try purchase premium.,negative
The best music app indeed.,positive
With recent update Songs are doubled up/ repeat themselves. Spotify please fix this issue.,negative
I love this app it has every song I could want,positive
Improve your add system,positive
everything is fine and nice...i am really enjoying it. but it would be nice if you can add romanized lyrics. or give us option to choose between for example romanized lyrics and hangul.. because not everyone can read hangul..so it would be nice if you can add it on spotify. i hope that you can consider it...,positive
"The widget on the lock screen is creating a lot of problems. Could not find a way to disable it. Samsung phone, Android 11.",negative
I love the music selection easy to use recommend it to everybody,positive
"This app sucks, I get locked out, change my password and it still doesn't work. Total joke. No response. They send me millions of emails but can find my account to fix it. Should change name from Spotify to NOTify.",negative
"The app keeps crashing, keeps stopping and pausing for no apparent reason. I have this app for one exclusive podcast, and the cost-benefit ratio between enjoyment and frustration is tipping very seriously in the wrong direction.",negative
Impressive library of music best I've found on any app.,positive
The app is full of bugs. Really dissatisfied with the apps performance.,negative
"Impressive, premium gives best experience",positive
The music is playing but no notification that the music is playing so i cant control the music such as play pause â© etc.. Please fix this,negative
Best app all songs available easily,positive
It's easy to use and complete content,positive
Kind of glitchy and the recommned for you songs are just half of the songs you are have liked but solid app,positive
The scroll slider is gone. Bad move.,negative

"Great app for music, I like the weekly Playlists based off of previously liked songs",positive
"Loving podcasts, never listened to one before. Can't wait to find more that I enjoy.",positive
The app keeps bugging and it suddenly closes after a song is over when I leave the app.. Also there are too many adds... Please fix these issues.. Else I'll have to move to some other app,negative
Good,positive
I LOVE SPOTIFYI love the song the speed in my soul Please make more songs like thatpleeeeeeeeeeeeease,positive
Forced ads on podcast now? At least ad something other than annoying music,negative
"I've been paying (money coming straight out of my account) for 3 months and the app hasn't work on any of my devices. Tried getting help from the support, absolutely no help, and I cancelled my account last month and it's still active and trying to charge me. I liked the app and worked fine untill they did an update on it a few months ago and now this has turned into trash. And you can't talk to an actual person... EVER!",negative
Music clear and loud,positive
the best music app. thanks,positive
Very good experience without subscription also XD,positive
Grate other than the adds but I understand that the ads pay for the app to even exist cuz this world sucks and nobody pays nobody nothing for anything and everybody struggles so hey man I'll deal with the ads you guys the app is great bye,negative
"I can't use my spotify, I don't know what happened.",negative
"Everything about the app is good (for a premium user). But Spotify should allow the premium users to download individual songs without making a playlist and then downloading the whole playlist. Downloading songs individually is a much more convenient feature. So, please make this feature available.",positive
"A vast compilation of music, anything you want, they got it. Totally recommended",positive
"I like your wide selection. It is easy to navigate around but I wish you could have my favourite album ""Keith and Enid Sing""",positive
"The UI glitches out heaps, I playing a song but it wont show where its playing.",positive
This is the Best Music App Ever Thank You Spotify ðŸ’™â¤ï¸,positive
I have lost the ability to pause and skip songs on the app.,negative
Good listening experience all in all. Sometimes it wanders off from topic :),positive
Fantastic !! No complaints what so ever. Keep it up you guys !!,positive
It is good appðŸ˜Š but listening offline is little bit irritatingðŸ¥². But I found most of the songs which I want to listenðŸ¤—,positive
"Overall the best music app, but glitchy. App will break at random and parts will disappear. Songs i have liked will not have the heart checked, but will showup in my liked songs. Car mode voice controls do not work. Some parts are getting better but some are also getting worse.",negative
"i have to pay in order to skip, loop songs and not have ads? thatâ€™s the whole point of me using a music app. if i need to pay in order to use these features, iâ€™d rather just not use this app. the unskippable ads are just annoying.",negative
"Can't shuffle my playlist anymore also can't play it through my car , I used to be able to but since update its not working properly I pay premium will quit my package now as can't even play,can't stop or play anymore",negative
Worst app . Very irritating. Ads are irritating me ðŸ™„,negative
The best app EVER!! I use it so much and the premium version IS REALLY WORTH IT! 10/10!,positive
I love the group listening feature. It's the only app I know of that lets you have a listening party with people,negative
Y'all should make your playlist where you can listen if your of line would take it 5 if you did that,positive
It won't play my podcasts if I hit play it plays songs that I don't even have or listen to.,negative
Everything is fantastic developers but 1 star less dur to no queue viewing option. Try to add the queue stuff it would be great then. Other than awesomeness.,positive
"I have all my music download, yet anytime I try to listen offline. None of my music is there and rufuses to play anything unless I go back online.",negative
Money by Lisa on the other playlist was replace by an unauthorized song. Fix this issue ASAP,negative
"Really good app. Just a suggestion, if you could give the lyrics for Hindi songs in Devanagari instead of romanisation that'd be amazing! I know you're coming out with english lyric translations, so kindly go back to using devanagari for hindi lyrics in the songs.",positive
Constantly loses my spot and I paid to no listen to ads. On android this app barely works. I constantly have to restart this app and refind my spot in every podcast. Not worth any amount of money. I'd leave if it weren't for Joe Rogan.,negative
Pretty good app. Would rate it better if I could thumbs down songs I don't like.,positive
Really like the music selection and the latest music is always on the app making it easier to keep up with new albums and hit songs.,positive
A really nice app when it comes to navigation,positive
App keeps crashing and wont open to play any sound since the last updatel,positive
"It is very nice app,I love it!ðŸ¤©ðŸ˜but the problem is that we can't hear songs offline it needs internet and some songs don't have lyrics.....So please improve them too..",positive
"Amazing, kinna wish you could choose the song you want to play",positive
Love all the content and the different artists and genres available,positive
"This app is rubbish. After playing a song you searched for it continues to play random songs with no option to go back or repeat. No way to see your own playlists. What is the point of this app? Whoever designed this would be better off getting a job selling hotdogs... The UX rating for this is a big, fat 0.",negative
"Premium is worth buying, Spotify - music soinds better with you... ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶",positive
"They're right fix your update spotify, I was searching the songs I like then I can't find it only showed up playlist. Im now listening to youtube, please fix this update. No Offence ha. I was having fun listening to spotify before.",negative
Just the fact that I can play music an go on other apps is 5 star for me,positive
Would be 5 but since updates it stops playing when my screen times out.,negative
"I've been using this app for years now and it's been amazing, but ever since the new update it's just been unpleasant to use. There are many glitches and the design of everything is just crammed together and there's too much to look at at once which makes it kind of an eyesore. I want the old, simpler design back.",negative
I love this app so much because it has all of my favorite songs and the lyrics are the best! Even if you arent using the lyrics the lyrics goes with the song!,positive
"With all the choices of music and podcast players out there, it's hard to stand out, yet Spotify does and does it fantastically! I would never use anything else!",positive
good selection for everyone in my family and at work. thanks!,positive
"Edit: Lately the app became buggy. The ""now playing"" disappears 50% of the times. Also every time I open the app and see the recomended playlists, it updates as soon as I touch it, so I usually wait twi seconds for the update of the home screen of the app. ðŸ™„ First rate: 5 âœ¨ Awesome app, I would appreciate if there was a sport mode, which can set the bpm with a toggle, like Spotify running",negative
Excellent app and content,positive
"Please change the play, skip and back button to how it used to be",negative
Make recommended song optional please It puts every song except for the ones I was,positive
"Not worth a rating. I have spot-ad-fy and another free radio app. The free radio app may not search specific musicians, but it does give genre specific music while spot-ad-fy gives music, yes but with so many more adds. It's simply not acceptable, but oh wait, they have a subscription service add free for approximately $11.00 a month, sorry I im going free version of a free a radio everytime.",negative
Has very bad things and very inappropriate.,negative
This app is very bad cant download music,negative
The app constantly freezes and resets where I left off during a song or podcast even with the latest updates. I do love the lyrics feature though.,negative
Got a good experience using this app. The app has a wide variety and stock of artist playlist and album of every genre...thanks a lot developer for this apply..,positive
"I use this quite frequently esp being I love multiple genres however My daily made for you lists keep switching on me when im listening to them. It's annoying cuz when I want rap or hip hop or newer rap it changes to industrial, when I want black metal it switches to doom. If there's a way to better compartmentalize my different tastes with out switching it up on me that'd be great. At least switch the artists up with in simular genres or artist and not totally shift into a different spectrum.",negative
Constant cutouts. Unplayable with wired headphones. Once the screen goes to sleep the app stutters while playing in the background. Reinstalled the app. cleared cached data and storage. Nothing fixed this issue. Please fix it.,negative
For some reason lately the app won't show that it's playing and just crash. Gets really had to keep track of podcasts and playlists,negative
"Thank you Spotify, though your platform may be buggy at times, I appreciate you being a beacon of sanity in these cancel culture times.",positive
It's great to be able to listen to a album of my choice,positive
"It's the best music app in my opinion but it has its annoyances anyway, like mixing up Podcasts and Music across the app, there should be a way of separating them, I use both but it's confusing and frankly annoying that I have to see Podcasts everywhere when I just want to listen music and viceversa.",negative
"Spotify is an excellent app, but payment is difficult in my region ðŸ¥º. A lot of us in Nigeria can't pay for subscription because it doesn't accept our cards. Helppppp! I'm gonna cry if I lose my music.",negative
"Honestly love this app, use it each and every day, in the car, shower, with friends and church groups, for listening podcasts with friends and playlists to fall asleep, wonder app, I've been on premium for 4 years now",positive
Love it although having trouble with not being able to play one particular album and cannot resolve it.,positive
Amazing! Never fails and has all my favorite songs.,positive
Overall i cna say it is an amazing app to install as the music can still play while you are on other apps and it mostly has every song you desire. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because someone may want to listen to a song but it wouldn't let you because you need special access it would be alot cooler if you could enjoy all the songs. Thanks for reading! :),positive
Love it all my best songs is on this just love it,positive
"Music is buffering when my display is off, Doesn't matter if I'm connected to wifi or mobile data connection or even if the songs are downloaded as soon as my phone's display is off musics starts buffering, tried all power saving settings in my give spotify all exceptions still nothing.",negative
Too many ads why are there ads I look every and every and every and just ads the ads are about how annoying the ads are if you know your annoying stop being annoying just ads I forget what this app does all I know is it just has ads mobile games should take notes of these ads cause so many why so many your tearing my apart it's horrible it's loud the ads they yell at me please be quite this is a libary they say they be gone for 30 mins they came back in 6 mins do ads know time please don't ads,negative
"I downloaded Spotify after they made the sensible decision to stand up to the cancer that is cancel/woke culture & the tantrums of the has been named Neil Young. Well done, Spotify. I shall be going premium with you as a thank you for standing up against the odious cancel/woke culture.",positive
"Having used both Spotify and apple music for years I can say Spotify is better in terms of music collection. However it's a very buggy app and I don't have an ""old"" phone. For example the app crashes without fail when I'm looking up the #2020wrapped stats. The way Spotify organizes it's music playlist It's super weird and doesn't suggest artists I actually listen to. They need to work on organizing the music better and suggestions.",negative
Such a disgusting and boring application it is. Continously showing add after each songs.,negative
I don't mind the ads because I can listen to most everything I want whenever I want !,positive
Easy to find songs. There is a huge variety. I love it!,positive
It's good on mobile as long as you have premium.,positive
"Everything's okay, really really good. But I have problem about when I want to share the song to stories IG, font is so big than normal. Pls fix it.",negative
"Ruined by update. Now, the song that is playing does not show up in app or even notification bar. This is terrible. Fix it asap",negative
I am enjoying listening to music which I have chosen,positive
"It is very glitchy lately, the play/ pause button on the bottom of my screen disappears, and I have to close the app to pause music. Also, does not show on my lock screen anymore.",negative
Best music experience!!!,positive
"I have no idea why but Spotify can't receive WiFi? The ""go online to play"" always pops out even though I have great WiFi and can stream on Spotify Lite/ Netflix/ YouTube perfectly and I've set streaming quality to automatic.. Extremely disappointing as a premium member. Edit: 5th June 2022, 1 year later, and this is still a problem! I have to uninstall and reinstall the app and it just wastes all the convenience of predownloaded audio",negative
"So i love spotify and I love making playlists but there's been one thing that has been making me want to combust. I can't listen to a little preview of the song. The little play button on the album image is gone and its driving me insane. I find no joy in making playlists anymore, and it's inherently difficult now. This app was amazing before you threw an amazing feature away. Please, bring it back",negative
"Great app. Makes it very easy to find and track songs, artists or playlists. Also, I love the option to download songs for offline listening. Very appreciated feature.",positive
I gave Spotify 4 stars because if you don't have premium than the app meh... And I have premium and it's great ðŸ‘ but you still get 4 stars. Nothing beats free. ðŸ˜‚,positive
I love Spotify ,positive
THE ADS I will play like 2 or 3 songs and get 4 ads and it's really stupid one time I got 3 ads and played 1 song and it played 4 more ads and it's really annoying because it wants you to get priemum if they will fix the ads I'll put 5 stars..most of the time the ads are like 15-30 seconds long and you can't skip :(,negative
poor customer service... Recognized there was an error with my account but refused to provide any type of compensation although I was unable to properly stream contents for weeks!!!,negative
"Ok so, I love spotify, its never really messed up until today. When i search up songs in a certain playlist it wont let me tap on it to listen to the song, which i do a lot to make sure its the correct one. I dont know why its happening, but I hope it fixes on its own.",positive
So good we can listen any songs such a beautiful app I'll love it this aap,positive
I've purchased a premium mini twice but I can't play the songs that I've pin on my playlistðŸ¥²,negative
"Music is good, but Joe Rogan and his lies have to go.",positive
The play/pause bar has been going missing for months. Nothing done by tech. Playing downloaded songs requires changing setup to off-line playback. That's dumb. Its because I don't have internet access then that's why I'm playing only downloaded songs. Switching back and forward is tiresome within the app. Needs a do-over. I just want to play music and not get annoyed by the app.,negative
Absolutely brilliant and amazing ðŸ¤© Music ðŸ‘ ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµ,positive
All my music plus more,positive
I love this app as it has all my fav songs,positive
"I would give Spotify five stars, but the fact that it shows ads every 30 minutes and only shuffle plays your playlists can be quite annoying. If only the Spotify app work just like Spotify on the internet, then I would truly be glad.",negative
After last update the app is crashing if i press play button and i saw many people facing same issue and they posted in Spotify community and it works fine when I install previous versions .,positive
"I just hate this app. There are WAY too many ads, like it comes every 2 songs or so. And you can't choose/play a specific song. Random songs that are out of the playlist start playing. Also I can't play a playlist that has less that 10 songs without random songs playing, like it's sooo annoying. If you really want to listen to music more comfortably and freely, I do not recommend Spotify. You could use other apps.",negative
"Can't pause, play, skip or view lyrics recently because the play bar doesn't show up. Also the music will pause a few times if the screen is off during a song making the app unusable.",negative
Nice,positive
Newest update has issues. Sometimes I'll leave the app open in the background and music will just stop randomly. Sometimes on shuffle the app will somehow lose track of what song is playing and it'll play 2 different songs at the same time. Closing the app with 2 songs playing and one song will continue to play despite me closing the app completely and there no way to stop it,negative
Great sound and the way a person can build a playlist fantastic!!Superb!!,positive
I enjoy listening to Spotify it plays the music I pick,positive
Good and easy to use,positive
Blank screen during vidoes Vidoe doesn't work for podcast.,negative
no lyrics confusing,positive
"Easy to use, has everything i search for and i listen to some pretty small metal bands, premium is great ðŸ‘Œ",positive
Latest update has made the playlist section unnecessarily complicated. Edit updated: Now an update has removed the ability to listen to local files on my laptop on my phone.,negative
Same Ad showing again and again sometimes,negative
Very rubbish!! Garbage app irritating to playing advertisement one by one,negative
"Love it. Any song,any genre,any era it's there. Brilliant",positive
Many songs of different languages are available... But the number of ads keep on increasing in small intervals if you don't have premium. And it's just so irritating.,negative
can you guys just gave back the preview song on the playlist search song so we can choose a good song?,negative
No super awesome on android,negative
Cool that you can listen without internet!!!!,positive
Nice Spotify premium playlist,positive
A very good music app i recommendit t everyone,positive
Easy to use and has all the songs I want.,positive
Very enjoyable! Sorry I did not know about it sooner. It has made a big difference to someone like me who loves music and can readily have my favourite music available. Thanks spotify!,positive
Spotify will add random songs to your Playlist and not let you remove them without premium,positive
Good,positive
"Spotify is my current favorite music app. They have a very good student discount, and such a wide music library that most if not all of the music I'm into at any time is on there. Plus it works well, never glitches and has a good setup for using",positive
Randomly skipping 3-4 songs in a playlist or album. App is useless right now.,negative
I can't get my Spotify app to work been working on it fo r days what's the problem?,negative

It don't never put on the songs that I asked for to put on that's annoying,positive
The now playing bar is gone. The app is now useless,negative
"It keeps getting worse. Covers stopped loading a while back, it is awful at detecting transition to offline mode, then at times won't play songs previously downloaded. Now it insists on shuffling all my playlists by default. Sigh.",negative
"Right after the update, the pp begins to act poorly. It crashes everytime I try to play a song. Please fix this issue.",negative
"Updated to 4 stars. Would be 5, except it still shuts down unexpectedly. Maybe next time. ðŸ‘",negative
Ayus na app,positive
"I have premium but even then, sme songs can't be played whole offline. For example, the song Cold Cold Cold by Cage the Elephant is gray and when you click on it it says it's unavailable. It's one of my favorite songs and I can't listen to it offline.",negative
There is so much variety and such beloved music. Thank you!,positive
Good,positive
"The recent update introduced 1 issue, most of my songs aren't showing up as downloaded offline even though they are. I have to pop data on for a sec to get them to register they are downloaded. This is a pain when I have poor service. This also doesn't seem to be just me, because my friends have reported the same issue",negative
"rockin out to a 200+ song playlist i made comprised of over a dozen bands id forgotten about since high school for the price of pocket change once a month? if a bad review of this app exists, i urge the Spotify official who discovers them to notify the individuals' next of kin and recommend they seek therapy or get checked for brain tumors",negative
I just love this. Much better than Apple Music,positive
It's about time they swipe to add to queue was added to android! Hallelujah!,negative
"Helps my 13hr days become tolerable throughout the pandemic,a great way to forget your troubles and chill.Never had a problem with it,and for what it costs it's cheap.",positive
Spotify is also part of Apple Inc and billboards are top charts,positive
Great music selection,positive
"We need a ""play last"" option to add a song in the queue. Pleeeeeeeese",negative
"I have a paid subscription for offline listening... it rarely works and says ""off line"", even for music I download.",negative
Spotify has to get its s#@t together. The glitching has become unreal.,negative
0 star will be perfect for Spotify,positive
I really do like it but you adding songs to my playlist when it MY playlist I don't like how you just added songs without me verifying but other than that an ok app,positive

Does not work at all! Have trouble when plugged to car and when I'm just trying to hear it on my phone it doesn't play anymore. Needs to get fixed ASAP,negative
"SpotifY SUCKS and their paid service Premium is a total scam. DO NOT GIVE THEM ANY MONEY. My spouse has a premium account,we are supposed to be able to have Premium Duo. But while I can login with google to my account, I cannot log in it to access Duo with the exact same credentials. Total waste of money.",negative
Unable to log in to spotify account. Tried to search email id or phone No. to contact customer support service but didn't get proper contact details where I can lodge complaint... it seems there is no any customer support service team... hence uninstalled.,negative
I couldn't getting any song just loading I have internet ðŸ˜­,negative
This is an amazing app but i cannot listen to the music i want to listen to the song i want unless i connect it to my tv or computer or ps4 and i cannot keep songs on repeat and its kind of annoying because the old update u could and now you need premium! I hope u change that soon because the new update isnt the best but ur app is still amazing!,positive
It was great app but after last update to LG OLED WebOS screenserver was disabled intentionally what can causes damage of your screed by burning out pixels..sic!,negative
Only downloaded Spotify because y'all did cancel Joe Rogan!!! And now I'm going to go follow him and look for other great artists!!! Thank you Spotify I'm sure I'll be very happy with the appðŸ˜Š,positive
App literally doesn't work. Nothing plays. Nothing loads. Web app works fine. All playlists say they are empty when they're not. LOL.,negative

This app is very good for music lovers!This is very good recommendation!,positive
GUUUD,positive
"I have been a huge fan of Spotify and a loyal subscriber for years now, but the latest update is a bit of a joke! Whoever thought it would be a great idea to take away playing of our own playlists at our chosen order and force upon us a shuffle mode is clearly keen to lose all this loyalty and monthly subscription not just from me, but judging by the number of complaints here, by many more as well! 1st time ever seriously thinking about leaving ðŸ˜” Fix it please.",negative
"I've been using the free version and I loved this app for 2 years, but recently the ads have gotten so annoying. 1-2 ads is okay every 4-5 songs but I have gotten at least 2 ads in a row after EVERY SINGLE song and I even got 6, 30-second long ads in a row today! They also removed the preview version, so now struggle to find new songs.",negative
Continuing to say no internet connection.. with full bars. All other apps working.,negative
"They changed how to play songs from a playlist/album. I do not need another play button for the current song. Before I was able to push play and it would start the album from the first song, now it just continues the song I was listening to the last time I was on the app. If I wanted to play that song, I would have clicked the play button on that song, not the album. Seems like an unnecessary change that makes it harder to restart/listen to a playlist.",negative
Enjoy the uninterrupted playing of music,positive
Thank you spotify 1,positive

Great music collection,positive
Just migrated fully off of siriusxm. Not looking back. Never had so much fun just recalling songs out of the blue or checking out nrw music I come across on sm. News podcasts fill in gaps well.,negative
"Whatever you updated in the most recent version makes Spotify unusable. I can't control playback from the Spotify UI or my bluetooth device. I cannot change the song as the ""Now Playing"" is no longer showing up. Makes streaming experience less than optimal.",negative
"I'm still in livechat trying to rectify the situation? Spotify refuse to fix intermittent fault, app is no longer available to install only player available which has intermittent faults even when playing music saved in library, Spotify says Too bad that's all you get on premium subscription.",negative

Nice app! It will be great if it have a korean romanization to all korean songs so I can sing along with it ðŸ˜Š,positive
"I used to love this app, hence buying premium, but since the newest Android update after locking my phone spotify will stop playing after a minute. This has never happened before and I'm extremely disappointed. If it doesn't get fixed soon I'll most likely stop paying for premium since I can't use it like I normally would.",negative
Great app .. although I wish the would work with pioneer 2600nex to get whatever glitch the new version has to prevent it from work.. otherwise 10/10,positive

"I like the app and really don't have a problem about the ads but it forces me to shuffle when I'm on a Playlist and won't let me choose what song I want to listen to or starts of with when listening.

It is way easier to work and workout with no looking at my phone,negative

The latest update has ruined this app. We have a premium account and are very tempted to cancel. It cuts out every couple of minutes and disconnects. The play bar has disappeared! Please fix these issues! If it doesn't get fixed then we will have to go elsewhere.,negative
I Love the app but on the phone it never let's play I song if says it is a song it makes it a Playlist and When I make my own Playlist It add songs that are recommended and that I didn't even want and I remove ever single one of them and when I play it plays some random song in the world and onesly I think it is just better to just go to the Spotify website on the computer and if keeps happening I might switch to YouTube music.,negative
Yo Spotify explain to me why every time I play the JRE podcast the app closes. But if I play anything else never happens. I will change my three stars back to five stars if someone can explain this. Yes I have uninstalled and reinstalled updated restarted my phone the whole nine yards.,negative

Every type of music of every generation is available.,positive
"Except the fact that there's no dislike button, been using it for at least a month now, and I can say that I've enjoyed every bit of it. ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ But y'all should seriously try to implement the dislike button option aswell",negative

How could you break the app so badly?!? FIX ASAP",negative
"Only app or service I use for music, podcats, and more. Honestly Ive never had an issue with the app or web player. Everyone should drop other music platforms and use this!!",negative
Great platform & music selection. Also love the podcast options.,positive
"Spotify was good before but after the latest update it has got worse because I can't play the songs that I wanna play it, and I can't download the playlists that I made and once when I was playing my ""liked songs"" playlist it played a song that it wasn't in the ""liked songs"" playlist and it wasn't in the ""recommended songs"" list so can please please fix this",negative
Great app. At least for unsigned musicians like myself,positive
someone fix this app it was broken then working and now player won't work songs don't pause and don't even go in oder this is the the third time I'm re installing I can't keep doing this,negative
Music stopping randomly. Not showing what's currently playing in app or in notifications.,negative
Chose disinformation over public safety. Moved many of the previosly free features behind the pay wall.,negative
Worst app for lots of reasons 1. Can't repeat songs 2. Always shuffles songs when I go to play a son 3. Lots of ads to get premium 4. Keep getting podcasts when I listen to one song so anoying 5. Every morning it restarts my songs really anoying 6. The settings on it is so confusing 7. Don't like how I can't repeat songs.,negative
It tastes like cheese with a dash of seasoning of seasoning,negative
"one profile randomly added songs of an artist named 'pesukone' into my playlist which I have not shared with anyone except my brother and a cousin. I blocked that profile. However, when I checked my playlist today, there was an other account named 'emma' who added songs of the same artist 'pesukone'. I blocked that account as well, however I was not able to report both of the accounts. Please explain the reason, esp if they are some kind of hackers or idk",negative
"Jesus this is frustrating. Even though I force close this app several times, it immediately opens in my car and I can't get it to not connect. It is ridiculously frustrating. Borderline useless. I hope the engineers that worked on this get diarrhea and a cough for a week.",negative
Latest update messed up the app. Sometimes the song being played just disappears and you cant control which song plays next. Requries forcedstop running again,negative
"It's a good app but recently I have had a huge problem with listening to music. Whenever I am using the app, it doesn't let me leave the app and listen to music. I have to stay in the app no matter what. I have tried connecting to wifi for it to load but it does nothing. I can't even turn my phone off or the music won't play.",negative
Adds are fine but cant play previous song shuffle is always on  I cannot play songs in my playlist according to my orderaddin songs to queue is a premium feature Cant skip to a particular portion of the song,positive
i love this app. i have been with Spotify for over 10 years.,positive
I'm having the same problem that many other reviews are referring to. Music and podcasts are pausing and playing when they feel like it. The controls don't always show up. Spotify was good for years but for whatever reason it has degraded it a near unusable state. I will be switching to a different service if this isn't fixed soon.,negative
Very nice app for listening songs and podcast also,positive
"I get an ad every 2 minutes, the skips are limited and I cant listen to the songs I want to. Do I need to say more?",negative
"Nice app for listening to music... But some music are not available, like Kdrama Boys over flowers song Love is fire by Kpop KARA and songs of Kdrama Heirs. The app has improved , now I want a feature to be added - translation of song lyrics in English.",positive

"I love Spotify but omg you should let us see what profiles follow our playlists! I beg of you it would be so cool ðŸ˜­ I'd rate it 5 stars then, other than that Spotify is great",positive
Not as great as apple music but yeah better than other music streaming apps,positive
"Every time Spotify does an update, everything messes up. Ever since this last update the app keeps force stopping and interrupting my music. ( We pay the premium so that makes it more upsetting)",negative
Finally purchased the subscription. I like it and am glad I did,positive
"I keep wanting to use this app for podcast and everytime I get discouraged. This time, I'm listening to podcast fine but I cannot pause it at all. The control to see what I'm playing is not there. Only way to stop it is to force stop it. I'll try again at some point but it's pretty unusable for me. Also, the controls don't translate to my car when I connect over Bluetooth. I'll update when these aren't issues.",negative
Beautiful beyond words to expressd,positive
"Some of the songs I would like only have covers, and often crashes while using",negative
"Album variety needs improvement, so many artists I listen to have way more than 3-4 albums of music, which I can hear on an actual FM radio. AND I never get my full 30 minutes of ad free listening even when prompted to watch the ad clip, half the time I get 3-4 songs totaling 14 minutes at best before the next ad is playing.",negative
love making playlists and i definitely recommend getting premium so you can listen to songs directly. love you spotify!,positive

Asking to re-dowanload songs every alternative day. Keeps logging out. Unable to download songs after the latest update.,negative
"The song 'MONEY' by LISA on some of your playlists (especially from TTH and playlist with million followers) has been replaced with an unauthorized song with an identical name. We have been reporting about that through email, twitter,and instagram since April 24, and you guys still didn't fixed. SO DISAPPOINTING!",negative
It's easy to use. An you can lesion to all your favorite bands,negative
Love everything this has to offer. U can listen to music with another person at the same time and change each other's music. Has lyrics for 95% songs so u can do keroke. U can hit replay. Make ur own playlists.,positive
I have been on adds for about 5 minutes now and it will never give me the 30 of add free music it's just one song than 5 minutes of nothing but adds,negative
"Great app me and my dad are using a premium duo plan, only issue I have is some songs I listen to get removed randomly.",negative
Great music it has any music ever created,positive
Honestly great experience. I tried the free premium plan for 3 months and when I was done bruuuuh I needed more premium and it's been great ever since ðŸ˜Œ,positive
The overall experience is amazing. The service and quality of sound is great as well but I'd love it if there would be more time stamps for sleep timer like 2 hours or something more than one hour,positive
So many bugs even after the latest update.,negative
"Just be careful you dont get scammed. They had me update my payment method and signed me up for a new plan without my knowing it - I thought i didnt have anything new selected, but apparently not. Its not about the few dollars i lost, its about what that behavior says about this company.",negative
I really love Spotify music,positive
I love Spotify because they have the music that I love so much.,positive
It was great until I had to play an entire Playlist to play ONE SONG!,positive
Worst app. Some days the app is nice and later it turns gross ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤¢. If I play a song it doesn't play it takes me to an entire playlist. The app was ok before the update. The update ruined the app. Take the update back as soon as possible...,negative
"Spotify used to be a great app in all aspects, but now it fails in every department except they have the largest selection of music. The worst and most frustrating thing, is now you can't even play your DOWNLOADED songs when your offline. There is a reason that customers need this option like myself (not to waste unneeded data daily), and this app fails miserably with a ""No Internet Available"" notification that doesn't permit you to play your songs at all. I truly hope they are working on a fix.",negative
"I'm able2 listen to all the music which inspired me throughout my lifetime an reminisce ""back2the Future""",positive
Everybody loves Spotify right u can listen to so many song for free,positive
I love that they won't cave into the woke climate! Best music app! Much better than I heart.,positive
No longer works on my phone!!!!,negative
I'll change this when the app stops bugging out if you go back on a track more than like twice it just won't let you without clicking on the song again or or going forward and then back back to a different track and then back to the same track.,negative

I love Spotify ! It's been so good to me . A lot of memories!â¤,positive
"Turns out Spotify leadership has a spine after all. Principles matter these days, and I refuse to give my patronage to communists. Spotify stood for free speech by refusing to remove voices, and that counts for something. Wish they would go all in, refuse to put propaganda labels on content, but I understand they do have to protect their business on these commie app stores. Overall, good job Spotify.",negative
Literally worst app I've ever used can't even listen to your favorite song when you click on a song it takes you to some completely different song. This app is dog waterðŸ—‘ï¸ðŸ—‘ï¸ðŸ—‘ï¸ðŸ—‘ï¸,negative
"Love to listen, even when off line. Thank you Spotify.",positive
Love using this app over the years. Also since i dont have social media i cant find another way to contact you guys. Keep up the JRE support. Dont cancel or silence him cause he is open to discussion. Keep the music flowing,positive
Been using Spotify for years and I love it ..the only things that I'm disappointed with is that there is no Garth Brooks.,positive

I've been a fan of Spotify for many years now & will continue to enjoy your service. Thank You So Much! ðŸ¤“ðŸ‘,positive
Apparently now my Spotify doesn't work well after the Android 11 update. It seems to not play my downloaded music at all. Only the not downloaded music can be played. What's the point of downloading music if you can't listen to it at all? Please fix this problem Spotify.(New update: now the player icon disappears after sometime using the app. I have to restart the app everytime it does that. What is seriously wrong with the software team?),negative
"Absolutely terrible! Toooo many ads! Pls opt for other apps, they have fewer apps with better UI",negative
"Used this since 2017, both as Free and Premium. I switched back to free in early 2022, and the amount of ads is unbelievable. It used to be like 30 seconds of ads for about 15 minutes worth of music and every now and then ""click here to watch an ad for 30 minutes"" and that was fine. Now it seems you hear two minutes of ads for EACH SONG regardless of length. Accidentally click on a song? Two minutes of unskipable ads. I'll be buying a premium Pandora account, Spotify ruined a perfect app.",negative
VERY CLEAR RECEPTION. VERY WELL SELECTED SONGS.,positive
I use this app to listen to music all the time and I still will but I just sat here waiting to listen to music but instead I got 10 advertisements in a row. I don't think anybody should be having to listen/watch 10 advertisements.,negative
Super easy to use,positive
"It provides best music quality than any other app, as it is more essential for good music experience. It has millions of songs and podcasts. So just enjoy listening music on Spotify. ðŸ˜‰â˜º",positive
I LOVED THIS A LOT NICE APP. DEVELOPERS ALWAYS TRY TO MAKE THIS APP MORE BETTER AND NICEðŸ˜Š,positive
The latest update crashes the app whenever I would try to add a Playlist shortcut on my Samsung phone's homescreen. But everything else is great.,positive
Nice,positive
There is so many ads,negative
"Hey, I love this app, but for some reason you can't listen to reccomended songs anymore on the ""add songs"" list. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but it just doesn't seem to work anymore. Anyone else having this problem? This is the main way I discover new songs.",negative
I've been using Spotify since 2012. Best platform for free music playlists. Love the no ads feature!,positive
"I've been with music my whole life, and Spotify helps when I'm doing work, on the road, or just chilling out. I've been using it for 3 years now and I love it.",positive
I mean its cool but I still have someone problems with it. When I look up a song it shouldn't take me to playlist with that song in it. I. WANT. TO. GO. TO. THAT. SONG. Also 6 skips an hour???? God at least make it 10. Or shortan the time of before you can skip again. Another one is that I can't go back to songs? Like what if I accidentally skip one I got slippy fingers smh. Overall pretty good tho,negative
"I dont know if its a bug or wot, but whenever I try to play a song, I search for it, turns it on but other songs starts to play on. This had disappointed me so much. Seriously u guys should fix this.",negative
It's actually the best music app ever I am personally addicted to it its just it contains every songs yeah some are not there but it's OK cuz most of the songs are available but the reason I gave 4 stars is some times it doesn't work properly so I have to re install it many times .... but else than that everything is perfect ðŸ–’,positive
Love Spotify...lots of music to choose from...the best!,positive
I love the fact that I can listen to whatever kind of music I like!,positive
"Good app. Sometimes it struggles to find the music I would like to listen. However, I use it daily for at least 9hrs a day.",positive
Awesome app.. u will get any songs from this app which u will like,positive
I love the app though the thing is they add songs you don't want and if u wanna continue playing the song you have to watch an add but it isn't that bad but if you could make a playlist without adding new songs it would be perfect and I would recommend this app,positive
They always have what I want to listen too. And it make me great playlists. Im liking it better then youtube music and Amazon music. I think im going to switch to spotify for all my music.,positive
You can get rid of those stupid Covid propaganda messages any day now. I might give you 3 stars you virtue signaling idiots. Stop if people wanted that they could watch TV. Joe Rogan is your biggest draw stop shooting yourself in the foot. You are better than that.,negative
"On the whole, it's great. Mostly a brilliant experience. The only gripe is that it doesn't go to landscape while playing music in full screen? It turns into a tiny interface in the bottom corner and displays no artwork and car mode doesn't rotate at all despite the phone settings.",negative
BUGGY as heck!! Hardly works. Offline mode is garbage most days. I use this on a spare phone with no cell data. So use it offline outside my house. Always have problems. Constantly wants me to redownload files i already had downloaded over and over. I am NOT paying for that. It blew through half my main phones cell data as i hot spotted it over to my music phone to try coaxing spotify to actually function. This is why people pirate! You should let us download actuakly download.,negative
I hate this app because every time when you go to play a song it doesn't play the song except play other songs.. The Playlist is way worse because songs you can't go back in a song which is the worst. The ads ugh I hate them they literally take for ever especially when it's loading.,negative
"It always plays the same songs, and making playlists is extremely tedious. If you want to add more than one song by the same artist you have to search for them over and over again after each song added.",negative
We have been reporting an issue of one song that has been hack but you still haven't make a move.,negative
Wanna break from the ads tap now to watch a short video,negative
"Mainly use this for Joe Rogan. I have many streaming options. If he gets booted, I'll just delete this.",negative
Added songs I never had correlation too and I can't even listen too songs without do a entire process,positive
"Well so far so good. Though one thing i noticed, i tried going for premium sportify even though it says first three month free after which subsequent month there will be charges, so after linking my card details it then pop up info sayin insufficient balance in account so i wonder why? Since i wont be charged for d first 3 months??",positive
The best service Im aware of,positive
"Actually it's good, but the ads when your enjoying but the ads",positive
"Very confusing and slow to use, stops playing music randomly and doesn't automatically shuffle similar songs. Poor experience.",negative
So far so good... I wish i can auto play the next song tho..,positive
Spotify is amazing but the ads are so annoying.,negative
The gray rooms are amazing Thank u Jason Wilson hoping for more,positive
"Recently just started crashing. Can't make it through a song without skipping or closing altogether. App used to be rock solid. Tried updating, clearing cache and turning on data saving features. Hope it gets fixed soon.",negative
Everything is great But ads are very irritating I know if iam not premium then ads will be there but insted of products and all you choose to ruin the moment which is not good It's kinda blackmail,negative
"Spotify mobile is a good way to stream music, although it does get annoying to have advertisments every 2 songs, they aren't too long and usually aren't terrible. But for the love of all that is holy you gotta add the ability to stop certain ads from playing, ive been genuinely turned off from listening to Spotify because of that garbage Uber eats ad that plays every break, it doesn't make much sense to force tons of ads every 2 songs, and to give the user almost 0 control over what plays.",negative
I enjoy the playlists.,positive
The best music app till now ...,positive
Mostly good service paired with a broken app. It is buggy as all hell especially offline on PC where it perpetualy reinstalls it's self then says it's ran into an issue.,negative
It crashes midway through a song sometimes but honestly having all my favorite music(except a few) in one place is worth the minor annoyance.,positive
"Unreliable app that keeps forgetting recently played songs and albums. I don't like podcasts, so the annoying constant suggestions to listen to those feel like ads to me, and I pay a premium subscription to avoid ads and enjoy the service, but the app shortcomings make it less than pleasant.",negative
"When o open it, it just stuck on the logo.",negative
App is good until recently music stops just by itself and no play or pause bar isn't available can't be paying for this,positive
"Lovely, enjoying music and very clear",positive
"Good app, local file thing is a bit weird to use since sometimes it doesn't save the files, but it works for the most part.",positive
Uninstalled this app after using it for years. All the sudden when I turn my screen off the app acts like I have low signal or dead ear buds. Nothing has changed on my end but there was an update recently. Going with Pandora now. Hope they can keep it running right. Bye Spotify!,negative
Still my go-to music app but they have tripled in the amount of ads they use which is why I put three stars,positive
I love this app it's amazing I love Blackpink and it has concert experience I love this .,positive
"There's a bug that I've been experiencing for over a month now. When you play a song in a long playlist, sometimes the volume will just turn low directly, and sometimes the song just keeps playing in Spotify but not in the background.",negative
"this is one the best bocus and useless app during creating account , i had became fullly angry.",negative
Good,positive
"why bother? too many ads, most good versions of songs are unavailable, or even just im general i cant find the good stuff here. feels like a cheap knockoff version of another app that actually does its job well",negative
"Awsome App!! It's great to enjoy the music you like anytime, anywhere!!",positive
Recently the app has been buggy. It lags and sometimes doesn't show media controls.,negative
"Why there is two copies of same song, ut confuses a lot...When im shuffle playing songs that i like it plays same songs everytime, dont know how their shuffle works cause i am hearing 10-12 songs everyday again and again which teases me a lot.....do something fix it improve it...",positive
The music is the best free music there is no more to say about it,positive
Although a bit overpriced the song selection and sound quality is phenomenal Waiting for Spotify DJ to roll out in India,positive
Best music app hands down!,negative
"After the last update, it constantly stops playing music and doesn't show the app bar in notifications.",negative
Need a better way to filter explicit content. Your filter doesn't work on podcasts.,negative
It either turns off while playing or won't turn off without shutting down my phone. Not good! Will find another app soon.,negative
"Terrible to listen to use for listening to music if you don't have premium. I just use it for podcasts. But there are so many glitches that the team refuses to fix, despite the amount of people having these issues, with no fix available. If you want people to pay, then at least provide a good experience.",negative
Love it . Other than commercials its perfect,positive
What the hell happened to the 30 minute no add interruption feature?- now all I get are ads after every. single. song It's SO irritating. Bring back the old feature!,negative
"Why is Spotify trying to open my audio files? I never gave it permission to open my audio files and it literally can't play them because they aren't music. I can't find any setting on my phone or in Spotify that controls this so I can't change it and I now can't listen to my files as a result, what is happening?!",negative
Spotify is fantastic,positive
"It is an easy to use app, and I can listen to music with no ads for 30 minutes. I can listen to music for free! Love this app ðŸŽ§ðŸŽ¶ðŸ˜Š",positive

Because the advertisement in this app is very bad . When you play more than two music then the advertisement intrupt while you change your music.,negative

Please for the love of God put the option to preview songs when adding them to playlists back. It is the best way for me to see if I might like a song or not when it randomly pops up. Bring it bacckkkk ><,negative
"This app is amazing, I works fine for me. But when I didn't have premium there were way too many ads and it's not fair that people can't choose their own songs when they want.",negative
It's downhill from here. Looks like the app glitches way too much. If this keeps up I'll be switching services for sure,negative
I like this app there are a lot of options but if you don't have premium the are ads.,negative
It crashes constantly or stops playing many times in every song. I stopped using it!,negative

One thing I HATE on my phone is notifications. The second. Notifications that don't go away or show up whenever they want. Seeing as I use my phone for my music source 3% of the time there is no reason that Spotify should harass me and clog up my notifications when the app is closed in the background. Uninstalled it to make it stop.,negative
So many fun things and songs,positive
"Awesome, to be able to connect to songs that touch the heart. I have enjoyed access to old church hymns, sang in full and with feeling. Great job to those who produced through this App.",positive
Great service just wish price wasn't do high ðŸ™„,negative
This is the best music on the store it has amazing quality and so little ads i would rate it a 1000/10.,positive
"I enjoy the music. It's my first time to use it, I am loving it already. I have my playlists, of songs I love, following each other without interruption ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„",positive
"Love it...no complaints. Love the customization, the ability to one particular song, and listening to an artist station that only plays THAT ARTIST and not similar ones too.",positive
A lot better than YouTube Music. Minus the being able to upload music without it having to be a Playlist.,positive
it great for listening to music but there's a small bug where sometime the 1 hour of ad free listening don't work like sometimes you watch it but it doesn't work or it Will not play the ad and ps even on fresh data/WiFi,negative
Does the touch of my hand work? I can't change the song? An annoying app.,negative
"Virtually any song at my fingertips, podcasts from my favorite creators, and I can take them to have with needing internet to stream! â™¡",negative
"Great app, access to music and constant playlists is amazing. However since the last update my music will just stop playing and I can't return where I left off as the play and pause buttons disappear. Not that happy about that, hopefully the small bug gets fixed soon otherwise I'll have to cancel my premium and move to another service",negative
Music keeps cutting and the play bar doesnt appear! Please uodate this and have it fixed.,negative
It is a very nice music app But The problem is the ads coming continuesly despite that it's a very good music app,negative
This containes too many advertisements which ruins the song and it's feel. Without premium the advertisement just come 5 to 6 seconds.,negative
Ok Nighttime,positive
"Great content, great service and all for a reasonable price",positive
Nice song and Simple play list,positive
I love this app so much! It's my only music software I chose after using them all,positive
"I loved this app as soon as i downloaded it . Its now giving a lot of issues. Like , i cant choose the songs i wanna listen to, i cannot even skip the song i dont wanna listen to . I go to shuffle to play the full version and it plays a song i did not even bother to choose. I think its unfair to those who cant go to premium because i cannot be paying every month , its useless. I dislike this app now. I wont waste my time going to premium. I hate this premium, so unfair.",negative
I definitely made a mistake and have been sleeping on Spotify,negative
"i like spotify cuz i can listen a music while playing on ps4, but there is problem since yesterday. all device that connected to my account has been logged out by it self, and then i can't log in. please fix this issue so i can listen to musics again.thank you!",negative
"I'm the type of person who prefer Premium Mini for when I feel the mood to listen to music seamlessly for the whole day. BUT the process of purchasing premium mini through spotify is so frustrating it kept on ""unable to connect"" and I've been ""retry""-ing for half an hour. My signal is pretty good but spotify doesn't even let me try to pay for my premium purchase ðŸ˜©",negative
"Spotify is probably the best music streaming app out there, but there's just one problem. When you say 30 minutes of free listening, does it mean 30 minutes with or without an ad? I get you guys are about monetization and are probably greedy for people's money but do that honestly. Other than that I have no complaints. It's just that a silly ad pops up during my ""30 minutes of free listening."" Fixing means they're 5 stars in my book.",negative
"Usually love this app and works fine on my phone but on my laptop its a mess. It closes down within seconds of opening it, and doesn't want to work. Sadly its only the spotify desktop app which is giving me problems, i hope they check if there are some bugs soon :) other than that love the app",negative
Can use it in background and easy to use,positive
Love listening to music and Spotify is the best streaming site out their,positive
Easy to use and set up play lists,negative
Its great no issues from my side very much actually,positive
I got to say one of the best audio music apps that they have so far Android atleast,positive
What happened to being able to preview a song when in the add songs menu Ina playlist? I can see the song and artist but can no longer listen to a snippet before adding to my list.,negative
"Was fantastic until recently when the app wouldn't let me play the music in my playlist however I needed it to. It would just pick a random song, and was unresponsive.",negative
Great app for all musics,positive
What's up with the volume being too low on android auto? It's way too low.,negative
Zero marks for machine learning algorithms. I'd play a song in one genre and the next autoplay song would be from a completely different genre. YouTube is the best when coming to song suggestions but because of the audio quality it lacks I am right now in Spotify.,negative
Love it so far! Listened to a lot of my favorite music. Now listening to Joe Rogan interview with Elon Musk!,positive
Great music and very good quality sound too I love this.,positive
"Ads every 5 minutes, just like old school Doordarshan. ðŸ˜‚ So I finally paid for Premium. It has the best collection of songs across many applications I've used.",positive
I've had Spotify for a few years. I love it,positive
Great. Playlist and recommendations are great. Occasional issues here and there but nothing too bad,negative
After the update Spotify stops playing after 5 minutes and you can't even access the pause/skip buttons. Not worth paying premium for a product that doesn't work.,negative
The update I really hate like it won't let listen the song want it :/,negative
Feature are very friendly quality is best,positive
"After the most recent update, Spotify keep closing whenever i try to play any song, idk where the problem is. It was working fine in the previous version but it's just not working now. My phone is iqoo z3.",negative
There so ad and makes me anger cause whenever my mood to listen song but whenever ad start play its very annoying after ad i really not want open Spotify plz we don't need any ads it's so annoying,negative
"Does not care that their download service for songs is broken, been 3 years begging them to fix the download issues. Spotify does not give a damn, moving entire family to another provider that can actually provide the services they claim to offer.",negative
"It's a really good app for music but I rate it a 4 star because there are 4 ad's after some songs, and I think that it's annoying to listen to a 30 seconds of 4 ad's. ( In my opinion )",negative
"Annoyed by how many unstable ads there are and decided to review about it specifically. I get around 10+ ads in a row and only 2-3 songs. Maybe 5 ads in a row at least. This is normal when I play music, and it shouldn't be. Rare for my playlists to have no ads for 30 minutes as Spotify states. It used to not be this messy. Please code whatever to fix this, it's an everyday situation. I shouldn't jump from each playlist to try and find the right spot to get ""30 min free listening.""",negative
"Better app and selection of music by far than Amazon. It has a lot more features to play around, find and delete tracks. Only thing I don't like is the way it seems to always want to play music that isn't on my playlist; It seems to think it knows what I like and plays suggestions. I can tell you that you don't.",negative
Its pretty good for your music,positive
"This is the absolute best for music listening, especially if you are ready to pay for your music. The quality is really supreme and crystal clear. Worth the cost of premium membership.",positive
Better off using web player. This app on a chromebook is unstable and always crashes every time I open it. It launches and then fails so I have to close the app and open it again.,negative
I love Spotify it's the best Spotify chooses song's for you song what u like and it's just perfect and it makes playlist for you according to what songs you like,positive
It is everything I could want in a music app. It has ALL my favorites and finds me new music to love! I don't think I could live without Spotify. It is truly the soundtrack of my life!!!!,positive
"We noticed that the song MONEY by LISA on some of your playlist has been replaced with unauthorized song with an identical name, we are sending alot of reports but still disappointed for this matter i hope this issue wont take long",negative
good,positive

"Keeps playing ""suggested songs"" on my playlist",positive
"Spotify keeps randomly pausing my music, and it keeps asking I want to allow Bluetooth control every time I open my phone. This is really annoying I'm so close to canceling my subscription and moving to Apple music.",negative
"Edited on 21st April, 2022 The premium service audio quality seems bit dull compared to telegram audio quality hope they fix it and rest I can't get over of Spotify.",negative
"I use the app almost every hour of my life and it's great, however a small issue is that sometimes songs downloaded to my device will just become unplayable, and this only happens in my favourites playlist not in downloaded songs",negative
"Absolutely love it. This app provides amazing music (and nostalgic parodies), sure the ads in lite are annoying a bit, but premium membership is AMAZING and reasonably priced for add free listening. Would enjoy if you could .mp3 download your playlists tho. 4 stars!!!",positive
"Needs the option to download new episodes Playlist. Not sure why this option doesn't exist, I'd switch to Spotify as my primary podcast app if this happens.",negative
I love the many podcast selections,positive
Spotify has been satisfying with every urge for my music hunger. It's efficient and has almost every song. Still loving the app and how efficient and catering it is when it comes to all genres of music and podcasts.,positive
I liked the songs tht r playing thts y i gave it a 4 nd not 5 bcuz it has 2 much ads which i dont like playin in between while i am listening 2 my favourite tunes,negative
"What have you done to this app??? I stopped using Spotify because I get YouTube Prime+YouTube Music for a better deal.. it's Better value for money Â£ - I can watch my favourite YouTube 6 & listen to my favourite new Music ""on the Go"" much cheaper than if I buy both. I have a separate YouTube account/g mail because my Son (18 year's old) likes to play Silly ""bollocks"" with my favourite App in the UK.",negative
Great app for when you're doing work or need to relax.ðŸ‘,positive
Its a really good app but its plays diffrent songs that is not in my playlist and i hate that sooooooo much,negative
Awesome convenient and easy to access I have no issues at all with Spotify,positive
"Hate everything. I hate the navigation, can't see the full playlist sometimes. Just want to find Moshpit by Que Violette, but its shuffled in a playlist. Just no. Not good for music, like I wish artists and podcasters would uoload somewhere else, Spotify SUCKS.",negative
Still learning but found it easy to use. I'm enjoying the experience.,positive
"Always using this app, have done for years it's great!",positive
The music is good but the fact that I play a song that I like it makes it play another song.i don't like it very much,positive
Love it but one downside is i pay $10 a month for downloaded songs that never show up when I dont have signal. So it's kinda feeling like a waste of time and money.,negative
I'm loving it tremendously one app I would pay for has everything I need I came only for joe Rogan now I'm here for every Patriot pod cast they have. 11 of my friends left I tunes for Spotify,positive
It's awesome we can heare so many songs at best quality,positive
"Absolutely love it! Got a premium account right away a few years ago, totally worth it! I use my account on phone, tv, and especially my car! The ability to make personalized playlists is awesome!!!",positive
I pay for premium. Their are constantly bugs where I cannot see/pause the audio that is playing Playing something I have downloaded while I'm offline (typically when I'm flying) takes ~5min to load. And most importantly they're taking my favorite JRE podcasts. Don't think they'll keep the content you enjoy,negative
"I'm using this aap last one year and I have good experience with this aap. I used to like that the ads were not much, an ad used to come in 20 30 minutes. That's why, I used to recommend my friends to download this application. But for a few months, ads come twice every 10 15 minutes. Now I don't like it. I think that the ads should be reduced a bit, it is necessary to take some attention to spotify.",negative
I love Spotify it has so much good music but it needs to add more xxxtentacion songs,negative
It's amazing I love it and use it all the time to help with my anxiety,positive
"Update - issue was fixed with new update ... Galaxy Watch 4 - Unable to delete offline Playlist, have to delete an app and reinstall",negative
I don't use this app much often but it good because my opinion matters and yours does not,positive
I hate Spotify because with out premium u can only skip a couple times and when u search a specific song u hardly get that one without listening to other music and if u make a Playlist they add random songs and they usually suck,negative
"Spotify has become the definition of trash. It's filled with glitches, which is especially ridiculous considering the high monthly payment. I honestly wonder if they hired 5 year olds to code this app. An example of one of the many glitches would be, my songs being shown as unplayable when I'm offline, even though I downloaded them.",negative
I love Spotify so much the songs are great but i wish that if i put one song it doesnt put a bunch of others with the same title in a playlist there arent that many adds but there are more than it had before.,positive
"Spotify sucks, for so many reasons. But for consumers, it sucks because the shuffle mode doesn't actually shuffle anything. It just chooses songs you've heard a million times, or songs that are most popular. They have no plans to fix this issue. I wish I could give you 0 stars.",negative
"I have yet to not find a song I want. I like to making my own Playlist and it makes it easy to do so. The only things I didn't like was how it has a ""skip song"" counter that goes against you. It also doesn't let you listen to your Playlist in order but randomly plays. Other than that for $10 a month for the Premium service, it's a good deal.",positive
"I love Spotify ! It's cheep, different libraries for different ðŸŽ¶. Examples country, rap, rock etc. Love it !!!!",positive
App is slow amd glitchy. You can download music but navigating menus when you have no service is practically impossible which defeats the purpose.,negative
I love it. At the moment I listen to podcasts while I work and thoroughly enjoy it. Keep up the great work,positive
Literally my most used app. It's incredibly good for music lovers and playlist enthusiasts! Playlist creation is incredibly easy and intuitive. Sharing music is easy and the library of music is nearly endless. 11/10.,positive
Its sooooo good to lissin to music,positive
"I have used my Spotify on numerous devices over the years. That being said, Spotify has always been a challenge to play music and podcasts in areas with less than great cell service. Web pages and YouTube videos will load but Spotify will not. Very frustrating when I pay for this subscription. Saved music and podcasts take extremely long to register when offline and will often tell me ""no connection "" Overall I love the content so I will keep paying",negative
"I've been using Spotify for my music since like 2011 and have been a premium user for probably the last seven years, absolutely love it. My one problem consistently is that I cannot reorganize the songs in my ""liked"" playlist which is my main playlist. I just wanna be able to put the songs in order in the way I like them. Otherwise it's great.",positive

Pleasing to hear the list of songs to calm down our minds when it is stressed,positive
Its is a fantastic app for listening music with lyrics,positive
Wont let me skip or turn off shuffle spotify isnt bad but spotify mobile is horrible.,negative
Really enjoying this. Creating a major playlist and taking it everywhere. Now I can hear what I want on the radio.,positive
all the feature are fine for me so far but everytime i update the app why all the songs that i like gone? mind to explain that problem?,negative
"I've been a premium subscriber for years now and usually Spotify worked fine. But recently it's been awful. When I open the app and play music sometimes it takes a good 10 seconds to play and the animation when I press on a song is glitched, so it dims it and stays like that. And when it does play, ""the now playing"" doesn't even show up. So I can't pause or skip without going into my notification bar. Fix this now this is ridiculous! I'm about to switch services coz it's been over 6 months now!!",negative
"Cannot dismiss playback notification! Ever since a recent update, I haven't been able to dismissed the playback notification when music is paused. I don't use the new android 11 playback persistent notification so it must be a bug in the app, because my phone hasn't gotten any updates before that",negative
Big respect to Spotify for standing against the powers that be that are firing thier very last feeble shots at free speech. This is an amazing platform for all ideals and opinions,positive
When I'm on WiFi it says not connected to internet. Works fine if I connect using mobile data.,negative
last version was good.it is very bad no song forword,negative

I love spotify app,positive
"I liked that it have all the music around the world, and it is the best platform to put ur work in and let the world listen to it. The grouping and recommendation is also good.",positive
Terrible experience when using it to stream on Sonos. YouTube music plays wonderfully but Sonos takes minutes for some of the speakers to start working,negative
Best app for listening music. BTW please add more vocaliod songs thank you XD,positive
"Whenever i play a song, it always stops at 9sec. I tried everything but still doesnt work.",negative
Dont use this bad app,positive
"Spotify was fine, I never paid to remove the ads because I don't mind them. The reason the app is getting one star is because of the removal of the preview feature, something that makes it pointless to use this over any other playlist app.",negative
The App used to be great. Lately it is so ridiculously flawed I'm not even sure why I'm paying for premium anymore. To keep things short it simply doesn't function. Too must frustration for what its worth.,negative
I love this app but does anyone know about karaoke mode how do i get it?,negative
Was very happy the first week. After that I found out I am not allowed to choose which song I want to listen to unless I use premium. Garbage designed to infuriate you to pay money. I'll just go back to YouTube,negative
Love it,positive
Totally cool nice interface,positive
Ver good songs app in every language,positive
This app is good I mean it has a lot of songs and is nice and the ads aren't very long really.,positive
Last update has loads of bugs with music stopping and can't see the current song being played and I can't skipp song or pause due to the update now,negative
Why is there cover image as my lockscreen background. Could you please remove that feature. It's really irritating. No other platform does that (or gives you the option to remove it) it destroys the minimalist approach I tend to do on phone.,negative
FIX THE SHUFFLE also pretty good there a bit to many ads though. E,positive
I really love listening to music with it,positive

I am a longtime user on Spotify and I am rlly despaponted in it right now because after a few months actually a year this random shuffle starts and I don't want to pay for premium right now so not sorry but it randomly shuffles it when I don't press the shuffle button I hope and the repeat button is gone I hope u can fix that for free accounts-._-.

It was working great at the start but after ONE DAY it completely changed and it was really hard to use. If it still worked i would give it 5 stars,negative
You scewed this app up entirely with the last update I have had a subscription to this app for years but the last update is TERRIBLE!!!I can't tell what song is playing and I have to go the whole way back to the playlist to change the song taking away the bar to tap on and it bring up the song playing was a horrible idea and it has made using this app a hassle if it is not changed I will be canceling my subscription its beyond infuriating not be able to just click and bring up what's playing,negative

I absolutely detest having ads at the beginning of Meditative music and Soundscapes. Its absurd! Some things should be off limits. Period.,negative

"A music app that really struggles to play music. It's never been a great app but recently it has become utter garbage, bugging out and requiring multiple restarts a day, refusing to show downloaded songs when off-line, and a new bug where songs randomly pause for a few seconds then continue, even downloaded ones. Has become such a pain that unless the next update fixes it I will be cancelling my premium account.",negative

Like I click on the icon, the Spotify logo comes, it goes away, and there is nothing but blank space. I've tried waiting for 10 minutes to see if something happens but no. Nothing. And then I have to reinstall the app again. This is literally the 10th time I'm reinstalling it. Please make it better. I love spotify but It gets annoying after a while.",negative

Very annoying app. Every time I opened the app it would pop up a useless request or recommendation with no option to turn either form of spam off. If you're just looking to listen to podcasts use Google's podcast app!,negative

"this app is ok. a few suggestions: a bio option for your profile, a more accurate friends listening activity, and an actual 30 minute break from ads bc most of the time its like 10 minutes. its also annoying bc my playlists with 200+ songs on it will pretty much only play the same 5 songs without playing any others.",negative

"When I 1st got the app I barely used it. It was different than what I was used to. Now I use this app daily and would not want to go without it. You just need to take a little time to get your favorite music , specific songs and more. Nice!",positive
"After hearing so much about how ""great"" this app is I decided to try it out and honestly it just blows.. I don't see what the big deal is. It's no different than any other music streaming app.",negative
Best music app there is nothing beter,positive
"This was a 5 star rating when I had premium. Now it is a 1 star rating. They add songs to my playlist and refuse to play the songs I put on my lists, instead they force me to listen to the worst music in history. You can only skip 5 songs and they always play more of their own before they play yours. Ads after every 3 songs.bcant skip those either. It's truly a horrible and frustrating experience!! Don't use this app, find a better music service that costs less or is free.",negative
Best app for free listening music with different language along with different types,positive
"Excellent entertainment app. Books, Ted talks, music...it has it all",positive
Great catalogue of music and unlike other we'll know music services premium doesn't have adverts,positive
I'm on the road all the time this app is great for the random Playlist,negative
My absolute favorite music app! I just wish it could be a little more organized when you search things up or like with the podcasts and shows. There are also way too many ads. I understand they need them for it to be free but dang.,negative
"I would also like to say that I pay for pro, and the app was my favourite go-to for everything. I've noticed that just in the last six months or so, I've been having the same problem as others it seems ðŸ˜’ - with not being able to play my downloaded songs or saying I'm offline or just, just bugs.ðŸ˜’ It's beyond a drag and I'm considering cancelling my subscription.",negative
Ugh. My internet is working just fine but the song won't play.,negative
I don't like it u can't pick what playlist you want to listen to unless u pay and u can only skip 6 songs a hour and I don't really like how glitchy it is,negative

"It doesn't work on free fire when free fire run, song are automatically switch off",negative
Great and easy to use.,positive
Love this app! Used to use I Heart Radio but it was starting to have some glitches so I switched to Spotify & haven't looked back. Has the same amount of ads as I Heart Radio does but there aren't too many ads where it becomes annoying.,negative
"Cool app, but an upgrade is neeeded in the next update on 19.5:9 screen ratio isn't stable",negative
"I have not had a problem with this app until now, It just updated about a week ago and I found that all my playlists in app were empty. And spotify made playlists were too. Nothing will play. And on the web player everything is normal. I tried this newest update, just a moment ago and nothing is fixed. Good job. ðŸ‘",negative
"I used to really like Spotify, I usedit all the time, recommended it to my friends and family ( many of which have gone premium), but not anymore. Recently while shuffle-playing my favourites, a long carefully curated collection of songs, suddenly songs that aren't on my list started playing, and not on or two, song after song after song by artists which are so dichotomiclly different from my taste in music just shoehorned into my playlist as if the belong there, tainting my user experience.",negative
I can find what I'm looking for easily.,positive
"The Spotify algorithms work well, but the app has broken UI in dark mode on MIUI Global 12.5.6 (Android 11). The play/pause button has incorrectly set colors, as well as some other elements on the play screen.",negative
This app lets me listen to my favorite music whenever I want. Really helped in some dark times in my life.,positive
Works well as advertised. Brilliantly synchronizes across all platforms and devices.,positive
"Was far better but new update awful! Glad the player returned so can pause and skip again, but now when in car and get a WhatsApp message or a call, there's no way to get it to continue playing the song following the alert as it used to!! Only reason I subscribe is to listen while I'm driving. If this isn't fixed, I may as well cancel my subscription!!",negative
"Good app, but the amount of ads is absolutely insane. I recount once getting 10 ads in a row. Please fix this issue :( the app is otherwise fantastic.",positive
This is the best app thanks for Spotify company,positive
You gotta play ad after every songs and that too three ads all at once you need to understand that not everyone can use premium! Fix this thing please rest it's a nice app if it doesn't play ads after every songðŸ¥²,negative
This app is so annoying becz of advertisement I would suggest plz uninstall this app and start using gaana app it's way better than Spotify...they are indirectly forcing people to purchase premium,negative
Great music and songs ðŸŽµ ðŸ‘Œ ðŸŽ¶,positive
DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP It have almost every songs you want to listen but even though I KEEP MY INTERNET CONNECTION ON THIS APP SHOWS THAT YOU ARE OFFLINE I JUST CANT SEARCH ANYTHING I COULD ONLY LISTEN SONGS FROM MY PLAYLIST ITS VERY FRUSTRATING  AND ALSO I HAVE REALLY GOOD HIGH SPEED INTERNET STILL ITS HAPPENING,positive
"Like Spotify under Family plan, also love the UI interface but the audio quality is bad specially for rock/heavy metal music, after 4 years using Spotify, I finally switched to YouTube Music and the quality audio is amazing, specially on the car.",positive
Ok. I like everything here. EXCEPT FOR ONE BIG thing. Recommended songs. It just adds on my playlist in a random place. I just hate it. I don't wanna listen to song that I don't know!,negative
"Would enjoy using Spotify more if you stopped promoting right wing propaganda podcasts. I don't want to see Jordan Peterson's nasty face every time I open the app to listen to some music, thank you very much.",negative
No method of playing songs from all the followed artists (shuffle artists),negative
Excellent. The only thing missing is program notes. But the extent of the library and the availability of new issues makes up for this.,positive
"Spotify says the whole time that I can't play a song 'cause I have no internet. I downloaded my songs, so I could listen to them offline. Somehow it doesn't work and I can't listen to them when I'm at a place with no Wifi. Please fix this Spotify. It's really annoying.",negative
"This app is not used for Kannada people, only showing Telugu,Tamil & Hindi, please not install the kannada people",negative
It was working good but for 2 or 3 days it shows me 'No Internet connection'.,negative
Constantly closes or stops playing. Often freezes when ads come on for old podcasts. It is a poorly optimized app despite such crazy success. I pay for premium but I feel like this is a scam. I will switch to another app once a big competitor arises.,negative
Love making playlists,positive
"I dislike that you have e to pay to listen to songs in a order, or pay to have skips. I was fine with the ads, but I now cannot skip songs I don't want to listen to, and I can't shuffle or loop my queue.",positive
Mobile app is rather good but on wearOS the app is very limited. I can't even search for anything.,negative
"'Hey slow down you have only 6 in one hour"" is rude. I should not receive that when I have not subscribed",negative
"When I play a song, it plays a complete different one that is ""similar"" to it",negative
Too many damn ads!!!!,negative
"it's always good but now it has many problems, hope you will release any updates soon",negative
Where is Spotify HiFi? All of your rivals have adopted lossless audio quality. I would have migrated to them if they were available in my country but unfortunately I'm stuck with sub-par audio quality on Spotify.,negative
There are way to many adds and every time I try and buy premium it won't let me. The ads are ridicules you here more ads then music if you are going to download it just enjoy the first few weeks where the ads are not unbearable.,positive
The latest update is clearly awful...,negative
"I love this app because it allows me to listen to all kinds of music and podcast, I definitely recommend this app.ðŸ‘",positive
"Why is everything so zoomed in now? It makes it much harder to use. Also, Spotify is recognizing audio files on my phone despite it not having permission to look at my files.",negative
Download playlists that I can't listen to. What's the point in downloading if you can't listen offline?? Paying $11 for this BS is frustrating.,negative
The best music app on platform especially for a diverse listener like me whose has playlists varrying from Harayanvi to Italian Opera Its a great app,positive
"Tech bros behaving badly. The technical aspects of this app are overwhelmed by management's contempt for musicians, healthcare workers, and anyone else that gets between them and an easy dollar. Can no longer condone the antics of these brats. Bye!",negative
I don't why it's keep getting closed automatically with out any error,negative
I like the way it broadens my horizons with similar music. I I found Spotify through Last FM. Last FM kept dumping me into Spotify. What the heck is scrabbling?! Where is the tutorial. Learning curve wasn't as bad as I thought.,negative
Good app ! But plan subscription is really expensive for me,negative
Awesome,positive
"Music. Is. Awesome! I want to sit and listen ALL DAY! I love it, reccomend it, and play it. Please git it. It has a reasonable price, or, not too many ads. ðŸ˜",positive
third class app,positive
Love Spotify Use it everyday at work and never have any issues ever,positive
"Disappointed. Every two weeks it seems that the servers go down and the music is unable to play for days at a time. For an app I pay for monthly, it would be nice to be able to use it. I don't understand how this is such a common occurrence.",negative
used to be a carefree experience with premium on my pocophone f1. but now the tab that shows playing music and lets me control what im listening to (next last loop etc) dissapears after leaving app or generally like every 15 minutes atleast so that i have to restart the app everytime to get it back. not acceptable for a premium service. and my phone is not old so i dont see why they update bugs into the app. shouldve turned auto updates off to not give them a chance to screw it up.,negative
There is a bug where the player won't appear even when listening to a song (in the app) and the notification player doesn't show the controllers. AND the music will stop playing if the phone screen turns off. (Samsung Galaxy S10) it used to work fine before.,negative
Good,positive
"I love how it gives you so many good options, and like how you can leave the app and the music won't stop. But I wish it didn't have a very long commercial.",negative
I love this app but only problem is so many ads other than it was good app,negative
Simple and inviting! Nothing counter intuitive to confuse anyone who needs a music platform. For gen x and before the idea of the latest interfaces is intimidating at the very least. You've exceeded greatly though simplicity and by adding nothing superfluous. Thanks.,positive
"Shuffle isn't a true shuffle, it plays what it thinks you want to hear with no option to change it. I use this for a public facility and it plays the same song multiple times in a span of an hour.",negative
"Very impressive app, but, please help us download some music so we can play it offline.",positive
The ad system is alright you get an ad after 30 minutes. BUT!!! You get 3 ads. One 30 second ad and 2 10 second ads. I have a bunch of songs that i have liked and are saved to my favourites and somehow songs i haven't favorited ended up there. Please fix this.,negative
"I enjoy Spotify, I just have to remember how to use it!!",positive
"I had three months deductions of $10.99 withdrawn from my account for premium that I didn't get and therefore didn't use. Their 'help system' is not conclusive enough as they kept asking me for 'merchant numbers' which I couldn't get, and that's just the 'chat' tried calling them direct and got some hindi sounding man everytime who wants my debit card number & that's at the contact number. I regret the day...",negative
Used to be able to see lyrics while on the free plan and the moment I subscribed for a premium plan I lost the feature :/,negative
"Songs have been glitching with interruptions during streaming for a few months now, I have deleted the app and reinstalled and the problem still persist, will go back to Amazon music next month if this issue isn't fixed by then. Still no information on your hi-fi lossless either damn shame",negative
I really like Spotify. Easy to use. Can find most artists.,positive

Nice,positive
Easy to use. Creating a playlist was a snap,positive
"Just a cash grab at this point, they stopped giving me my 30 minutes of uninterrupted music and I don't know why, I can only skip 6 songs (and it's extremely frustrating when a song I don't know comes on that I didn't put on my playlist) I can't even chose the song I want to listen to and the audio keeps skipping during the songs, just use an adblocker website and listen to music that way guys",negative
"We have been Reporting about a song of LISA (Blackpink) Replaced by another song from the past two days to Spotify, but still there is no response from Spotify team & the issue has not resolved.

Neil Young deleted and some misinformation podcast instead! Is this a music app or what? Sort your stuff out Spotify or lose my premium subscription.,negative
"Wish it worked better on the Roku operating system, but I love the service.",positive
"plays ads on podcasts even though I have premium, what's worse is it restarts the podcast when it plays so i lose my place edit: the app is getting worse, it's crashing all the time for me",negative
I love Spotify. It is perfect for me in the car when I'm driving. I can turn it on and find what I wanna listen to and press play and go. There is limited commercials and it has everything I want to hear.,positive
"This is the reason why I don't like spotify, I mean this happened to my sister. a lot while changing her fav music the other music will appear and when you ran out of moves it won't swipe now because of it and you still have to find the way that your fav music will actually appear.

Lots of ads,negative
"player breaks every time a song is not playing for more than 5 minutes with the new update, need to restart the app constantly",negative
Thanks Play Store for giving at least 1 star,positive
"I'm giving it 4 stars, not 5, only for 1 reason. You can't select multiple songs at once to move in or out of a playlist, which means if you wanna build a playlist, it takes a lot longer than it should. It should be the same way your Gallery works, how you can tap and hold to move many pics / files at once. Other than that, spotify is awesome. Having millions of songs at your fingertips for the price of 2 starbucks coffees a month? Worth it =)",positive

"I've been paying for over a year now and it was awesome at first, but every time it updates, it gets progressively worse.

"So you choose to cut an actual artist and musician like Neil Young but keep someone who is telling people to take horse dewormer? That's eat-the-tidepod stupid. I'm already looking for other music services and won't be a paid user anymore.

When I logged out it never opened again. I reinstalled and restarted my phone. It's still stuck at the spotify logo screen.,negative
This app has been on of my favorites but recently I've had a lot of issues with the app. Sometimes it won't let me skip songs and it keeps glitching! Spotify fixes these issues ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,positive
"A very good app with many songs, podcasts but the only problem is when listening to anything, advertisement disturbs you and will spoil your mood. Otherwise a very good app",negative
This app would be good if not for it taking over any device it is on. I start comp. There's Spotify starting up. I start phone same problem. I know I could change it and problem solved but that is just one example of little annoying little insertions into my daily life. There's also the fact if I start it on android there is no quick way to stop the app. And even when I do stop it there is still the notification to continue listening I want to. That is not helpful it is annoying and needy,negative
As an independent artist I believe Spotify is so waytogo keep up the good work!,negative
The music or podcast episodes whatever I was listening would suddenly stop and the app would restart by itself. Which is quite annoying.,negative
Why it is not showing it's details and i m not even able to add songs in playlist. Plz do something for this glitch....,negative
Every time you go to listen to a song it plays recommended songs you didnt add and I find that mechanic annoying because it plays songs in your playlist,negative

"An amazing app for Listening music! Perfect quality and facilities! The only thing I didn't like bout this app is that we get a lot of advertisements which can ruin our mood for listening music ðŸŽ§. So, the thing that i'd request them to change is 'stop putting a lot of advertisements.",negative
My most enjoyed app. No adds and good music as you want am.,positive
In the last couple weeks the podcasts will cut for addbreak but then it starts playing a different episode with no pre warning and when i go back its not even in the place it left off and shows i finished it when i know for a fact i haven't,negative

It has brought music back into my life and songs I had long forgotten never underestimate the power of music means so much to so many people thank you spotify,positive
Untill last update it was awesome. But new update is too bad. They made it complex for the sake of design. It's too difficult to navigate between songs while searching,negative
Can you add this feature fore Spotify we can listen it on background if we listen doring playing that's more enjoy full,positive
It meets my need for kinds of Christian gospel music that I like to listen to.,positive
Pay to win app basically. I can't play ONE song. Like it only shows a 5 seconds preview of how it sounds. I can't even listen to any songs on my playlists. There is no point it's a PAY TO WIN APP,negative
"I've lost count the amount of times I've had to reinstall this app to get it to work as it should...its only a matter of time until it starts to bug out again, drop outs, dissapearing media players, massive connectivity issues. The customer service is atrocious...if you can find it. How much money does this app make again? Amazing poor quality experience all round considering.",negative
Great music although try and create a platform for Kenyan music and east African music at large its too much of Nigerian music,positive
"I have a Premium Plan I use on a Samsung, but after the latest update I can't listen to anything at all. It tells me I don't have internet when I do. It tells me all the playlists are empty. If I look up a song, it won't play it. I have deleted the app, restarted my phone and reinstalled. I have cleared the cache and data and then done all of those steps. I have done the ""clean reinstall"" steps. The only time I can get the app to function is if my SD card is not in my phone. Not a solution.",negative
"What has happened with Spotify??? If you opt to shuffle a playlist it always plays in the same order. I have a 5+ hour playlist I have created and if you play for more than 2 hours it starts repeating songs in between, the other day I heard 2 songs 3 times in a 2 hour period",negative
"Play bar disappears constantly. I'm frustrated that 50 percent of the time I start the app, I can't pause, skip, or play music. This issue started within the last seven days. Spotify needs to fix this issue. As others said, many of us pay for the service...",negative
"Been using this app to play music but the recent update is straight up garbage, it won't let me play a single music on loop and whenever it shuffles it automatically plays random music that isn't even in my playlist, whatever I do, even if I exist the song and go back to my playlist it will play the same music, once the song is finished it will play another random song that is also isn't in my playlist! The old Spotify was already great and yet the new update made this all fall downhill",negative
Been with Spotify since the beginning always easy to use loads of music and artists Im surprised they have  definitely love it but yes u got to pay but for a person who listens to music 247 work car  and home yeah its definitely worth it,positive
The app is superb. Very cool app to play music. The favorite options and lyrics follow up is ðŸ¥‡,positive

Please fix the issues. Latest update and still having the issue of not being able to connect. Or play downloaded songs which are downloaded for a reason. And the app just stops functioning like many others mentioned I have to exit the app fully in order to be able to control what's playing.,negative
Stopped downloading playlists for offline despite saying downloaded and for some completely unknown reason the like button has stopped working. App used to be great. Turned awful.,negative
"Wheres the Music? I get 4-5 ads per 1 song. I dont even get the ""30 minutes ad free"" (wasnt even a full 30 btw) anymore. I always end up back on Pandora for music.",negative
While listening to podcasts the app pauses sometimes 10 to 20 times an hour. Sometimes it will close out of the podcast I was listening to and I'll have to find where I was. Very irritating. This has been going on for months.,negative
Excellent every song ever wanted in my library and my playlist Great sound excellent,positive
new update won't let me see songs playing or pause or anything. Was nice before. Now not so much. kinda ðŸ¥”ish,negative

Glitchy App; skips and pauses songs randomly. Glitches getting worse. Looking for alternatives.,negative
Everything is good except taking to long to get to song,positive

It's good but Why can I not play the song I want to play. It always plays a different song than I'm picking. And 6 skips per hour? That's stupid,negative
"Recent update has bugs - playing music with no control bar visible. Can't control pc on phone without the app glitching (literally). If this can be fixed, i will give 5 stars because it's an awesome app all in all",positive
Enjoying the music. Very little to no interruptions! Great mix of music as well.,positive
The new version updated of Spotify is not good because in their they asking premium we can't go back and not get freedom to change the music with out premium. If it's gone in this way the people will not use this aap they will be gone for other aap,negative
This is the bestest app i oftenly use this during my office works,positive

Its all great but the group sessions need a bit of work! I understand its in beta but would love if there was an inbuilt chat or something,negative
"App worked great on my old Galaxy S9, got a new Galaxy S22 and now it's glitchy. App shuts off when I hide the screen, podcasts jump ahead for no reason, marks podcasts as listened to when they are new. I checked to make sure I have the latest update, not sure if there's something in the settings I'm missing?",negative
Too much advertising while playing songs.. Boring app..,negative
"Use this than any other music app, this has almost everything someone could have",negative

spotify is very conveint way to listen music,positive
Good music and podcast app. Just a shame that I pay for membership but still get advertisements. Seems wrong to advertise premium for ad free listening to just throw ads in anyways.,negative
"I don't pay for this app, and I did give good reviews to people about Spotify, but recently I'm living at a place without internet, and all of a sudden my 2.4 gb worth of songs are no longer able to play because I'm not connected to internet, went to a timmies to see if I can update it and the, did download 500+ songs but now I'm trying again later in the night and still getting the same problem.

Amazing ,positive
Dont even bother with this app. It has been 8 days and I havr not been ablr to use the stop and pause function when playing a song! I have uninstalled abd reinstalled this app at lest 40 time.

App does not seem to work on Samsung Galaxy A50! Cannot search for music. App crashes if I attempt to add a song to a Playlist and cannot see Playlist after adding songs on the web. No option appears to play songs either. I have deleted and reinstalled the app several times and have logged out and back in several times. I have done everything that I know to reduce background apps running and ensure wifi signal strength. Simply put your app is not compatible with my phone.,negative
It bothers me that I am unable to view lyrics on my cellphone. Other people have them but not me.,negative
"Such a useless app. It is only playing ads but when it comes to play music there is no sound , shows black screen. Net ia perfectly okay with youtube , insta , zoom also with video ads of spotify. But it's not able to play songs at all. Wth ðŸ˜ ",negative
Love the app but would have been better if Spotify free had a little more accessibility on mobile.,negative
Your new updates are terrible I cannot do this garbage if it doesn't change I will no longer be a paying costumer like how do you rewind or fast forward or even skip songs now just stop y'all are doing too much for god sakes stop,negative

Hello! Thank you for not removing the storage selection settings. I suggest having Play Next button/option.,positive

"Useless, I live in Quebec so cannot have premium. Better going amazon music .",negative
"Been using and paying for this app for years, however compatibility with the Samsung S22 Ultra is trash. Every time I use a different bluetooth device, Spotify won't play music through a different one. It's connected as I still receive calls and notifications through the speaker. Whenever I want to use a different device I have to uninstall and reinstall the app.",negative
I give a 3 star writing simply because I do not want to start over this app used to be great I used to love it but as of lately it has been very glitchy and adds songs and playlists on its own. I pay for premium and it does not give me the premium service in which i pay. Until i find a better app ill stick it out for now,negative
App doesn't work properly on samsung s22 ultra. Will Continue playing and won't respond to pause or play function. Have to restart app to fix issue. Also android auto function is slow and buggy. Suggest using Google apps instead.,negative
Sometimes the player won't load. Otherwise it's fine.,positive
"SPOTIFY ON PHONE SUCKS. ON PC AND ON TABLET, ITS WAY BETTER. I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY FREE USERS CAN ONLY LISTEN TO PLAYLISTS AND ALBUMS. I CANT STAND SHUFFLE PLAY. PLEASE MAKE SPOTIFY ON PHONE LIKE ON PC AND TABLET. I HATE SHUFFLE PLAY.",negative

"Bunch of ads in between songs can't buy premium because it doesn't let me and just I can't play whatever song I want, and it's always bugging out.",negative
Subscribed to download playlists as I work remote. Have experienced multiple times where entire downloaded playlists refuse to play offline or simply disappear entirely. Forums indicate this has been a problem for years yet no fix.,negative
I used to love it but now you press a playlist and it will give u another song that's not even on the playlist pls fix that and it also adds songs without you wanting to add it and can we pls download songs to hear offline ? For free,negative
I love it. I get to explore different podcasts I hear about.,positive

I want to love this app but music discovery isn't close to being as good as on Pandora and my 2019 Volkswagen Jetta keeps experiencing bugs with this app almost daily. It also has difficulty pairing with the car.,negative
Nice and clear music to listen to.,positive
Literally the worst account security I've ever experienced on any type of platform. Add two-factor authentication to your service.,negative
I opened another account on Spotify with a different email wanting a free entry of courseðŸ™„. Long story short...I've got three months FREE premiumðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰. Now all I'm waiting it's August 2nd(Thats when the offer ends) And re-do it all againðŸ˜.Hope it's not ILLEGALðŸ˜‡. And yes I'm not willing to pay anytime sooner.

Spotify is my favourite and most likely ðŸ˜Œ in my home it would have to pay more more than I have been paid ðŸ™ƒ for the first time in my life I have been trying to find out if my self or not salama po,negative
I am going to leave this 1 star review until the fix the problem that doesn't let you skip a song or hide it to skip even though you have 6 free skips a hour. Even better would be if it never put the hidden song in the playlists again.,negative
Very cool and easy to use,positive
"first off this app isn't free at all i mean with features like being able to skip 6 songs per hour,pushing songs in your playlist by force, and not being to play exat song one by one in your favorite list and not being able to making a song go forward or anything you are forcing users to buy the premium. Don't even let me start it on ads that you have to listen to 3 or 2 ads after two songs .i think you write down LIMITED ACCESS instead of FREE USE.",negative
its good just wish u can have unlimited skips on mobile,positive
"I love the app BUT I don't have the lyrics... I don't know why. The app is up to date, I pay the Premium version but I still don't have it. Why?",negative

"Sketchy app performance on multiple android devices. Downloaded podcasts won't begin to play unless you have internet connection, which is why I download in the first place. App malfunction causes play/pause to not be displayed. Sometimes have to force shut down app to stop it.",negative
Spotify is my life... especially after I've upgraded to premium... I've my music 24/7 with me and I could never get over it.... easy access to all the kind of music and the way it can be arranged makes it a special platform to connect to music... I love it!!â¤ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ,positive

"Why the fugk can I not disable this app from blasting every time I start my car? If I want to listen to something I will open the app. It's extremely annoying and I'm very close to canceling this service because of this issue. The disable battery feature use to work, but ever-increasing the android update it starts itself weather I want it to or not.",negative
I love listening to Joe Ragon's show. I respect you independecy. I don't respect musicians getting involved in politics. A musician should be able to hear all kind of music not only his. Please stay independent and open to all subjects. You owe it to the new generation.q,positive
Plays songs that aren't even on the the liked song playlist and just litters it with songs from genre you don't even like listening. Good luck listening to something like metal because you'll get forced to listening to love songs for lonely people.,negative
No scroll bar in liked list when it had one up until the most recent update is annoying. Makes it hard to quickly get to a certain section of a long list.,negative
Great range of music,positive
Audio clarity is not good,negative
Exceptional.. 4 stars just coz of the annoying ads in free version,negative
Latest update killed the app. This got to be a late april fools joke. Crashes half the time,negative

Difficult to keep accounts straight when running a duo but great functionality,positive
"I really like Spotify, I don't have proplem with ads but shuffle and only 6 skips per hour is sooooo annoying! I neither want to pay for Spotify premium nor switch to another app, and this makes Spotify really hard to use.",negative
Just love all the great music choices!!!,positive
At first everything was too good and now after having a proper network connection I cannot search songs and after some how managing that after some time I cannot find the lyrics card of the song which I heard when i was using this app for the first it was showing but not now please fix it.,negative

Easy and clear to use for music. Don't listen to Joe Rogan. I use Spotify everyday I love it.,positive
It is a very good app for music,positive
I'm a platinum user and I can't believe how much is available for me to explore,positive
You cant preview songs anymore before adding them to playlists this is super annoying especially when you find out you added the wrong song,negative
Great selection and sound,positive
Good app... But i would also like to suggest one thing. I would like to see the lyrics of every song without having to swipe up ... It means that i want the lyrics box to stay fixed so that i could see it without having to swipe up for every songs...,positive
"It's good that you can use it for free and listen to playlists, also podcasts that you're into. The two issues I have are that sometimes (most times), I can't listen to the podcasts I've downloaded offline. Then the other is that you can't start a playlist from the beginning, a lot of the time you have to continue the playlist. I used to start another playlist then back again to start it from top but that has not worked in a while.",negative

Great music but theres some bugs,negative
Love dis apps but why does my playlist keep disappearing when I have updated the premium program?,negative

Make the whole app premium at this point,positive
I haven't had any problems with this app. I have been using it for a long time. I would just like to suggest that there should be an option to select a few songs at once to add to a playlist. Sometimes it is a bit frustrating to choose songs individually.,negative

Would be 5 stars but Spotify keeps adding annoying songs to my playlist I dont like and wont let me remove them.,negative
"I left Spotify for about 2 months to try Amazon music. Worst app for music and now back using Spotify again. Doesn't crash, doesn't pause for laooding each song streaming, doesn't require restarts multiple times.",negative
It's good but lot of advertisement,positive

This use to be a great app but there is way too many ads between songs. 1 or 2 is fine for the free version but 6 or 7 is ridiculous. I will be searching for a new music app unfortunately,negative
"The app is garbage, nothing ever loads, I'll press play on an play list and it play random things not on the play list, I'll play things form a artest and the next song isnt by them, the app never works none of my playlist transfered to my new phone and all it does is lag. Absolute garbage!!",negative

"My Liked Songs Playlist was around 11k+ when i started to have troubles with this app. Spotify seems to be unable to handle a playlist this ""big"" and i can't really see why. If i search for a song or just add it to queue it works fine. But i can't play it straight out of my playlist anymore. This happens on all devices i tested (Macbook, iPad Pro, OnePlus Nord, Windows PC) and is really annoying. I am willing to wait a bit till all the songs are loaded. But at least play them at some point.",negative

I dont even get the song i wanna play! I only get 6 skips per hour and the updates they make are a HUGGEEE downgrade. Im done with this app.",negative
Terrible. Taking its cues from ITunes and trying to force you to listen to what they want to push. Try to make a Playlist and when you search a specific artist it let's you choose one song and goes to a long list of songs from other artists that they want to push on you ... awful.,negative
This app is amazing. I love how you can listen to music anywhere you go. 10 out of 10.,positive
Overall good! Have noticed a lot more ad's in-between songs which I dislike.,positive
"Love this app you can listen to all of your favourite songs but there is alot of ads like I get 1 every 2 or 3 songs and they say, ""Watch this ad to get 30 minutes of free listening""",negative
It's the best app of music I have ever used,positive
The app was great for some time but recently it hasn't been working. If I search for a certain song it plays a totally different song even when I'm listening to playists. I'm not even able to make a song repeat or carry it back. It's getting pretty annoying now so it would be appreciated if you tell me a solution or fix it. Thank you,negative
"I love this app, and have paid for premium but literally every damn time I install it, and open it, and exit it, for some dumb reason that I have yet to figure out, it uninstalls itself!!!! WTH is going on with it and how do i fix it!!!!",negative
Gitchy at times. Front loaded ads to the point I just shut off and go elsewhere. Thought about paying for premium but not if they cant even figure the basics out.,negative
"So far, so good. Only had a week but reasonably easy to navigate.",positive
Not working properly,negative
I like music and u,positive
It's quite annoying that I can't control my music. It's happening more frequently that I can't see the play controls. I have to force close the app to stop the music. Unsure but might be related to my phone recently upgrading.,negative
Its a good music app.,positive
"Best app, best songs, sounds good , all information about singers , best service , continue.",positive
"spotify is good but idk why, maybe its a new update, but lately i havent been able to preview any songs while in the search bar. so basically i have to add the song to my playlist before I can preview it to hear what it is",negative
"mann ! best app for online music ever the one who made this app is a legend such a good quality of music and simple ui worth to install , also some motivation speeches and best thing is you can share any script of lyrics on your social media . thanks againnn !",positive
"Realistically Spotify has their own 5-star rating in my book! As a lifelong diehard music fanatic and somebody whose interest in podcasts is on the rise, Im especially grateful Spotify aleays matches my vibe, ANY DAY/ANY TIME.",positive
Best music app i have ever used no cappðŸ™Œâ¤,positive
When Is the bug for changing and stopping a song going to be fixed? I'm paying for premium to use a s#!t app why? It's been like this for weeks now. Sort your app out,negative
Feeling So good for listen her songs her ads posters vdos All good spotify team ,positive
This app is very nice to listen music,positive
"It's good to use and it can relax, it also helps me study when I want music, so I go to spotify",positive
It's gotten to the point where it's not even enjoyable using the free version of Spotify. Try to get free 30 minutes? Watch atleast a good minutes worth of ads just to not get 30 minutes of free music. Then the first song playing isn't even in the Playlist.,negative
The library and content sure have expanded over time but I hate how the app has weird glitches where it won't play music I downloaded.,negative
Fantastic! Easy to use and making a playlist is simple.,positive
How did I manage without this for so long? As an older person I had almost stopped listening to music. My CDs were all from years back and I didn't listen to them anymore but I had no alternative. I simply hadn't made the technological leap to an online system with a Bluetooth speaker. What I love most is being able to make playlists again and share them with friends. What I love second most is that Spotify then plays you new music it thinks you'll like based on your choices. It's a revelation!,negative
"I've had this recurring bug, and it's become more common recently where the music controls completely disappear. The controls in notifications is gone, the bar on the bottom of the screen in the app is gone, and I can't even find any way to access the main music control screen. The only way I've really fixed this is by going to the app settings in Settings and force stopping it, but it's just really annoying. I'm paying for premium and this isn't acceptable.",negative
There is no adds but it edits all my playlists I recommend getting premium,positive
Out Standing bass and sound quality....... I like it ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©,positive
"Even on the free version , the sound quality is great , ads are ok-ish , can't ask for more for free",positive
"Spotify is amazing! I love it! It's the best option to stay updated about news, listen excellent podcasts and great music!",positive
This app is okay but you turn off similar songs to be played. Spotify still plays them. 1 star for lack of functionality on their part.,negative
Great and good music A wide variety of it to But to many ads,positive
The app has been buggy the past couple of days the play bar just doesnt show up,negative
It's pretty good but the adds are anoying without prwmium,positive
Like the app but I don't like is the dumb advertisement,negative
Best,positive
So awesome,positive
Fix your stupid app. It's been crashing for months now,negative
Great place to be. Lots of lovely and superb music to reminiscence with.,positive
5 ads before I can listen to one song,negative
Best music platform with good audio quality,positive
If you don't take premium the app will say you will get 30min of unintrupted music and after 2song the ad will come and this is the worst app i have use of all musicðŸŽ¶ apps. Pls don't install this app the worst app every ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¡,negative
Awesome Always playing this over any station on my Alexa,positive
Best music app in history â˜ºï¸,positive
Constantly closing or just a black screen when trying to open. I have updated the app and this still occurs at least a few times a day. Very annoying for someone who pays for premium!!!,negative
"My podcast episodes have been scrambling up. One finishes, and not the next one starts playing, but a completely different one. Can you explain this to me?",positive
"I appreciate Spotify for being diverse with genres and allowing for freedom of speech. Users are able to cater to what they would like to listen to and expand their mind whether it be with music, podcasts, books, and more. I've been a daily user for at least 8 years!",positive
Good app ..good music..,positive
"Professional, good quality of sound of music, complete music library, and still available for free package choice! I like it!!!",positive
"A very good app, the ads are not too overwhelming, and I like being able to get good music onto easy to make playlists. However, I hate that songs I didn't ask for are added to MY playlist. I end up listening to songs I don't like and can't skip more than my actual music. Sure this my be a nudge to premium, but I feel this addition on mobile may cause for less people even attempting to listen here. Other than that an amazing app!!",negative
Almost perfect better than Pandora slacker and that other one in my pointless opinion,positive
I love Spotify Its a great and easy app to use My only con is that there are a lot of ads on the phone version and the only way to get rid of them is premium On tablet and computer theres a lot fewer ads for some reason,positive
When it's not glitching it's amazing..,positive
"The app itself is okay, but only just. Spotify the company however is just terrible. I've made the switch to Tidal and it's so much better.",negative
The small mini player at the bottom constantly disappears after a recent update.,negative
"Good for listening to music, but it doesn't play the song I want to play. I go to my playlist, press the button that plays the playlist, and it plays some classical symphony. Please fix this.",negative
I give 4 stars becauseits a bit expensive per month. Other than that my favourite music app.,negative
This is being a great app for music and podcast I have been using this app for many years now I have re installed it spotify is giving me little problem in listening for the podcast and playlist it's not opening my playlist so can you please just clear this problem otherwise the Apple great love this app â¤,positive
Ever since i moved to india the app wont let me login at all - and i was on the premium tier. Gone are all my playlists and downloads. Not a good experience and its such a bummer because i spent so much time categorising all of my favorites :(,negative
"Just like many other people here, I struggle with the disappearing play bar and randomly stopping songs. These thing didn't happen until several days ago but now they became a thing and they are really annoying. Reinstalling the app and clearing its cash didn't help. Please fix these bugs.",negative
I just love this app way better than any other that works amazing everywhere I go try it out don't be scared don't love it too,positive
Outstanding database of music. Like the lyrics feature. Looks of flexibility to create play lists.,positive
I enjoy listening to various talented artists. Thank you ðŸ˜Š,positive
"Terrible, I tried to listen to the songs I wanted to listen to but it kept playing random songs, fix it.",negative
We noticed that the song 'MONEY' by LISA on some of your playlists including TTH has been replaced with an unauthorized song with an identical name. Pls fix this asap.,negative
I can no longer access the imported files on my phone. Why is that?,negative
"I have no idea why but for whatever reason whenever I make a playlist on my phone and I play it, it keeps playing suggested song instead of the songs I want. It's very annoying and I can't find a way to change it ðŸ˜’",negative
"Spotify, your most recent update has provided me with a difficult/near-impossible interface to use. The music stops playing when I close my phone, there seldom is a bar at the bottom of my screen to see what I'm playing and sometimes I can't play my music even when I extensively press on the album/song that I want to play. Please patch this up thank you.",negative
Just the best app to listen to music.,positive
This is truely the best music app I have ever used and I've tried a lot of them. I love my music and this app has all the music. From the golden oldies to the latest.,positive
I am enjoying the crime podcasts to an extreme. Just wish there were more of them.,positive
"This app is awesome i listen triple x tentacion,BTS ðŸ’œ etc. Singers song there sound effect is amazing",positive
I love Spotify. Wish I can subscribe,negative
Great app for all musice,positive
In the beginning of when you open it you have ads but then it works fine just the 1 thing you should fix is to add more skips but over all it is the best app I have ever used for music.,positive
One of the main reasons I got Spotify is to listen to Joe Rogan. I can listen to him for free but I have paid for a subscription as a way of supporting and saying thank you to Spotify for allowing an open discussion on all topics and not caving to the immense pressure I'm sure they are under. Keep up the good work Spotify team!,positive
This is one of my fav app back then but now I'm getting irritated because it keeps playing songs that's not in my playlist and mixed the sings per album when I play it.,negative
"THE ENCHANCE FEATURE IS MY FAVORITE PART OF SPOTIFY , WHY WAS IT RANDOMLY REMOVED. I CAN'T SEE IT ANYMORE FIX IT",negative
"simple, easy and fun",positive
The music quality is amazing! Music is my stress relief and Spotify makes it an easy way to feel better. I love creating new playlists (I have like wayyyyy to many lmao.) Spotify premium with no adds is also definitely worth the money! I remember when I used to have to listen to adds and it really killed the vibe. 11/10 would recommend !!!!,positive
Best music app.ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ŒâœŒï¸ðŸ¤™,positive
"I had a small problem about a month ago with the app not working right with my blue tooth but all that started working right now. My phone updated yesterday. Now my Spotify won't work at all so I uninstalled it then reinstalled it, logged in and all of my music is GONE. Now I have start all over or get another music app. I am not happy and I am paying for it. That will stop.",negative
Good suggestions. Great dance music options when it gets me in the moose,positive
"Only got the free version, but it is really good. Lets you play music with a few ads every now and then. Can make playlists etc.",positive
After the new update my music bar doesn't show up at the bottom of my phone screen and I also have no controls in my top screen pull down menu. I'm on a pixel 6 pro.,negative
I don't know why but there are some songs that are unplayable.... I really like Spotify but because of this feature I am not able to play some of my favourite songs.... And that's really disappointing â˜¹ï¸,negative
"Please fix the lock screen functions for this app. Getting tired of having to do my full unlock passcode because it isn't working right after the last update for Android. Lock screen is still messed up, dropped this down to 1 star. Normally it's a full 5 stars for me but no man. Need to be able to quickly access from the locked menu.",negative
"Such a bad experience for a big companies app. It seems with every update they break something else. The ""now playing"" bar keeps dissapearing while music still plays and the ""like"" button refuses to change colour to show a song has actually been liked. I've had three different devices and have always encountered small problems like this.",negative
I want to any play song but when i click it dosent play full songs what is this...Sound cloud is much better than spotify,positive
"Too many commercials, but I love the set-up. The music is great.",positive
"Been very glitchy recently,. It's really annoying. I just wanna listen to girl kn red and mitski. Is it just mine or?",negative
"I love this app. It can be a little glitchy at times, but other than that In think its a great app. Ever since they added the lyrics option, it became my new favorite.",positive
"Great app. Was hesitant at first, but the JRE brought me here. Please continue to be against censorship and continue the great work.",positive
Its good if you can find a mode application,positive
nice very App,positive
"Had Spotify for years and has worked amazingly up until a year ago, now it's constantly crashing, pausing randomly, takes ages to load up and mixes all my playlists up.",negative
Songs stop playing in the middle of a track and goes to other devices. Re-installed app started happening after new update... still does it intermittent plays on Bluetooth... re installed 5 times. ... not impressed,negative
"It's a good app but those ads suck, mainly the ads which tell after seeing you can have a unlimited hearing , nothing will happen after the ad we will have another one in just 4 or 5min so please consider and reduce the ads . leaving that it's really a good app",positive
I love this app bc I can use it for trips,positive
"The app itself it's really nice actually, easy to use and has a big variety and believe me, premium is really worth it. What bothers me is that months ago they introduced the lyrics feature, wich I haven't got for some reason, I tried updating, cleaning the app's data, deleting the app and downloading again but nothing seems to work (I have Android 9). I tried looking for an answer and it seems I'm not the only one who has this problem, hope y'all fix this soon",negative
"I'd like to be able to remove a song from a Playlist that is currently playing without having to scroll through hundreds of songs, find it, and then remove it.",positive
I like using spotify to listen to music. It's great and they have all the artists I like.,positive
"Group play, you cant add songs just for one device to play anymore. You need to play it out your phone as well as everyone elses. It doesnt register that I am playing songs on other devices and doesnt allow me to change it unless I restart the app. Equalizer has been removed :( If these were fixed/added it would be 5 rated.",negative
"It would be nice if you could turn off autoplay for podcasts. It keeps adding previously listened to podcasts to the queue. I don't want a queue of podcasts; I just want to listen to the one I selected. I'm constantly removing previously listened to episodes from the queue, and they keep automatically being readded to the queue. Super annoying. Also, it won't bring up downloaded episodes when I'm not connected to wifi.",negative
"For some reason the performance on my phone is terrible lately (Google pixel 4a, Android 12). It used to be ok, but now I'm getting < 10 fps while scrolling my playlists. And the faster I scroll the lower the fps to the point where I have to wait for a second or two for the songs to be rendered",negative
It's never letting me play my licked songs or my playlists anymore SCAM,negative
Wonderful music and great variety,positive
"Every artist page is on shuffle automatically and I have to turn it off every time I go to a new artist. Along with other things I cant turn off, I might be looking for a new music streaming service.",negative
Great app. Easy to use and inexpensive!,positive
Best music app. Ive found and I tryed most of them,positive
Finding songs for any occasion is easy,positive
Not able to login in mobile. It's showing Error.,negative
The song which I want to listen is not played.For example I want to play lut gaye from Jubin Nautiyal.Other song is played but not lut gaye.Very sad.,negative
Very op,positive
Great App. All Songs available at a single click.Amazing.,positive
"It's a privelege to have this masterful creation soothing to my anxiety with great selection of beautiful creations flowing through my ears and creating inspiration and productivity through my days. THANK YOU folks for not being so stuck on ads, and opening up a new world of bliss in my chaotic, yet blessed life. You have a wonderful application here and options and ideas for playlists are endless. Would be great to work for this company if I could. Maybe, my Muzika will be here one day ; ].",positive
"Previously 4 stars, now 3 due to the controls no longer showing on the lock screen of my phone so I constantly have to unlock to change songs. Using headphone controls seems to scramble the songs now (tried multiple pairs, it's not the headphones). Playlist doesn't always pick up where you left off so after it's scrambled, then paused, you have to restart the playlist even if you know the song you were on. Just feels messy now",negative
"#WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. Spotify has gotten so big that they forgot us little people are the ones that put them in their IVORY TOWERS and GOLDEN THRONES. But they are like the STELLAR ROCKSTARS, and HUGE MOVIE STARS. They only need us little people is when its time to pocket our money.....Whats wrong with this picture????? Its a sad song.",positive
this is a great and thing to do and you can listen to your favorite songs and this is Samantha Schultz,positive
I love it I can look up what I want and it gives it to me with a few song I might like with it,positive
"I've been a premium subscriber since around April 2019, and have been very happy with the app, I've found spotify to be an excellent experience across all my devices. My only reason to give them 4 stars and not 5 comes down solely to the fact that I don't yet have lyrics available on my phone, but I'll certainly change it to a 5 once that's cleared up one day. Thank you for the excellent experience so far Spotify! Some lyrics would be nice thoughðŸ˜‰",positive
"3500 songs in my liked songs, and it'll keep repeating the same 8 songs multiple times a day.",positive
"Please add a non shuffle option. And stop add other song in my playlis, it's annoying ðŸ˜’. Its ok for just recommend it, but the song just automatically played without my consent",negative
love this app,positive
"I use the app to play music for my dog when he is alone, since he has separation anxiety. However, every single time, I come back and find music is not playing and the app has shut down itself even! I even bought a premium account, but it does the same and I just don't understand why on earth.",negative
Great music where and when I want it !!!,positive
"I'd be happier if Spotify didn't suggest AWFUL songs in all my playlists for a whole week. I listened to ONE SONG that was actually on my playlist. No matter how many times you suggest me traitor by Olivia Rodrigo, It's hidden in my list for a reason. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.",negative
You dont have control over the songs you want to hear and that's supid,negative
Best music experience ever,positive
I love how i can play all my fav song and make a playlist of my fav song or my best friends fav song...5 star I really recomend you to get spotify.(Spotify is the B E S T BEST!!!),positive
"I've had spotify since high school, buying spotify premium provided my first ""bill"" and sense of financial responsibility. I've built a truly sentimental relationship with this music app. Recently joe rogan podcast was censored and I'm leaving spotify because of it. I don't need my developers telling me what I can and can't do. Spotify = Sellouts",negative
Best music app ever.,positive
Best app ever â˜ºï¸ don't see ratings just download it fast,positive
Hell yeah,positive
"This app was one of my bests until an update came and since then I've been experiencing difficulty playing any music of my choice Before I'd click on it then it started playing, but now different things just come up making it annoying and repelling",negative
"App continuously stops when phone screen darkens on android, they are not issuing any fixes.",negative
I Love Spotify premium Quality music app ðŸ˜ðŸ¤—ðŸ˜˜ Thanks,positive
this is the best place to get music from i will choose this app 100%,positive
"It's time to cancel, your app is extremely buggy. It was great years ago but last 12month software has been horrendous. Scrubbing doesn't work, select a point in the bar doesn't update, offline doesn't cache, Scrubbing is an old issue and even after updates it doesn't work. I can select points in the bar to forward or rewind into play.",negative
I am fine without needing to pay for music so I get ads but I hate everything else. I should not need to pay to see what songs are in a album Suggested songs should be optional and skips do not reset at all i have not opened spotify in 5 days so HOW DO I HAVE NO SKIPS They have fixed all this so ya use spotify,negative
Love the music and my Playlist.,positive
"Doesn't work for me, I can get all the menus to load and I can select what I want to listen too but when I choose anything it just buffers and nothing plays. Really sucks to be honest.",negative
It has a lot of choices but it will pause my song mid way through or restart it.,negative
"It's an amazing app, you can just choose what ever song you get to listen any time or any mood your at. I can even play music whenever I'm offline,it also update me of any new songs .",positive
"Amazing app, if you fix that it doesn't add more than one songs to queue and randomly skips queues when opened and played straight from the bar below...And please bring lossless music asap.",negative
Better and better,positive
Please less the ads cause of this mood is very disturbed other than enjoying,negative
"Excellent service even very old songs,highly recommended",positive
Easy to navigate,positive
I love the App And it has cool mÃºsica,positive
Its ok but it needs more songs,negative
"Music should always be free, why not just make it free after Album has reached a particular target?",negative
"Sometimes crashes, oftentimes can't seem to get signal although the other apps seem to have no problem at all",positive
This app is amazing  premium user Its incredible I can listen to all the music I want I can create a lot of playlists I can see stories of my favorite artists etc I totally love this app Maybe the price can be lower but thats the only problem I remember when I was a free user and the ads were a little annoying For those reasons I give 4 stars ,positive
Love the uploads each week and certainly sends me the cool stuff,positive
"Even with premium there are still ads, the app freezes sometimes. I have 3 stars because they still support Joe rogan and like many of us, don't give two s**ts about Neil Young pulling his music. For the most part is a good app.",positive
The best music app ever ðŸ™ I love it,positive
"Well I loved them... UNTIL they made a gargantuan mistake by taking all of Neil young's discography completely off in favor of keeping Joe Rogan, so I will now be deleting the app and cancelling my subscription. I won't be back.",negative
"Easy to use, transparent app with all music you need.",negative
"Same issues as most after this last update, song stops playing randomly and have to reopen app to play again, 'now playing' bar disappears.",negative
"Pay for Spotify Premium, works fine 50% of the time and then others will show the songs as offline. Also downloaded podcasts are not available as soon as I go out of signal (ones which should be available offline). Not acceptable for such a premium subscription.",negative
Wonderful and awesome,positive
"Pretty good. I like the wide variety of songs, and sometimes i can have my music play while im on orher apps. There are a few downsides...",positive
"Tge app is overall very good,but the app pushes you so much to buy premium with adds,and there are no offline listening option without premium and there are many apps that give this feature for free.",positive
"I tried out Spotify years ago when I got a free trial of premium from Pandora, and I have never used any other music app since. I absolutely love the ""Made for you"" section that curates songs based on what you listen to. I've found so many new songs and artists I absolutely love and I wouldn't have found them without Spotify. Just get the premium, it's 10000% worth it.",positive
Trouble using when phone paired with vehicle but will try again after taking steps.,negative
Best streaming app ever!,positive
Nice,positive
Ad volumes varies causing unfortunate listening experiences. Today 5/6 Geico ads had much higher volume so it makes using the app disruptive. Marketers do this on purpose but there should be checks it place to limit this poor experience.,negative
"I used to like the app but the update ruined it. Like now you can't loop the song, you can't pick the song, and if you wanna do all of that you need premium. So be if we could have the old features back it would be perfect.",negative
Cool,positive
"so im giving it 2 star because the new thing where you only get 6 skips per hour and can't go back is just annoying me so much like why please revert it back i don't like this at all i cant even afford premium, just please fix this i don't like this :/",negative
Great music Playlist to choose from,positive
Good,positive
"Decent, when it works. It's always been buggy, but now it straight up deletes my offline music on my galaxy watch. One of the primary features of the app. It's like no one at Spotify does UAT before posting updates.",negative
Never plays the song you want it to. Always plays something you've never heard of before. How is this even a built in app. It's so bad. Oh also screw you,negative
"I used to love this app. It was the only place I got my podcasts and music but recently it either stops whenever it wants to or it won't stop without me uninstalling it. It also starts to play a playlist then plays a random song not on any of my playlists?!?! I have a premium account and am seriously thinking about cancelling it, it annoys me so much! Sort the problems Spotify!!! It can't just be me?!?!",negative
"I love Spotify, and all of the great features. If anything I wish I could add all of my liked songs from one artist to a playlist.",positive
"It use to be really good, now I can't even listen to my music because it keeps stopping after 9-11 seconds, I use music to help with my anxiety but how can it help when I can't listen, this has been going on for like a year now, I've done everything I could to stop it for doing it but still nothing, you're a streaming app, how can you stream without the music/podcasts playing?",negative
Apk free version is the best for Spotify ,positive
This is by far the best music app ever... Been using Spotify for many years and can't see myself without it... I love many different genres of music and they're all right there at my fingertips...,positive
"provides very good music, helps me relax",positive
Spotify started off great but...days later came out bad it won't let me listen to my favorite song on favorites list.and it only makes me shuffle :(,negative
I like it a lot. I pay for premium so no adds. I don't make playlists or do anything fancy. I put an album on and let it play then I pick another. I like that the app shows new music from artists you like. You have to click follow on the artist but it's no biggie. Plus it shows support for that artist. I like that it will show you concerts coming up from your followed artists. All that said for how I use it it is five stars.,positive
Excellent,positive
I dont like how when im listening to music it just stops right after its done and i have to go back to the app to press play for the next song.its annoying to do that consantly,negative
Excellent musical choices!,positive
"Missing features that are small, specifically customization in settings. But it's manageable, and still good",positive
"One of the best music apps, sound quality is perfect and functionality is flawless.",positive
"Omg this new update where everything is changed, I can't select a individual song off an album or any of my playlists. This update needs to be better or completely vanish",negative
It's a good app it does very well in what it should do 4stars because I don't have premium and ads. Not much ads but adddssss.,positive
Play button is just a white circle in dark mode. No download option per song. Podcast should have a separate section instead of mixing between songs in homepage.,negative
"I do love this app and always have. But I have some issues that I can't overcome no matter what I do. My favorite band does not play on my Spotify account. No matter what I log into, I still can't play songs by my favorite band that are even downloaded. I can only get it to play after long spouts of zero signal. And still it might not work. Why do adds still play over podcast when I pay for premium? I pay to not have any ads.",negative
"Been waiting for the update with lyrics on phone for quite a while but I still don't see them even though I have Premium. I have clean uninstalled and reinstalled the newest version multiple times, logged out back in twice as suggested in forums but no luck. It works on all my friends Android devices. Desktop version shows them for me. Unfinished/broken features on paid subscriptions is a big red flag for me. Gonna drop the rating to 1 star till fixed.",negative
"Easy play, and all singers and songs I wanted is here.Thank you",positive
"The application is 50 to 50, I use it only because of the lack of normal competitors, the application constantly allows myself not to display the bottom part with music control, music disappears from the playlist, pre-loaded is often deleted and these are the most frequent, the list is large",negative
Be nice if the 'I Don't Like This Song' option actually made the song stop showing up in the recommendations.,negative
It's good but I hare the 6 skips per hour..,negative
Wonderful when it's working hate it when i have to actually use the appon the phone,positive
"Spotify's service is a staple for me, but what would make it OH SO MUCH better is the ability to make Album Playlists. Call them Collections, or something. It would be a game changer. Imagine being able to follow The Rolling Stones Top 500 Albums of 2003, without having to surf through every single song?",positive
I used to listen to spotify all the time with premium and I loved it but spotify thought it was funny to do the most stupidest thing and to only be able to shuffle... WHY?,negative
"I like this app It have all types of songs Like party,lofi,pop,soft Types of songs So i like this app I have give â­â­â­â­â­star and i also like the sound quality that is cool ðŸ˜",positive
Good app tons of music choices Many days i choose shuffle and it shuffles properly... But one thing i liked is that if i choose a certain song according to my mood... It keeps similar mood songs next... Also eventually i am calmed and somewhat happy... Like for example if im sad or mad i choose a song describing my feeling...then as songs play eventually it comes back to happy songs and i feel better... Thanks spotify :)),positive
Stopped working this morning for some reason.,negative
"I really enjoy Spotify it has many songs and podcasts, you can listen to, it's also nice that if you download episodes you can listen offline .",positive
Great app tons of music,positive
"I'll give five stars again but after this update it's buggy as hell. Now playing bar never shows up, freezes, (Update: fixed ) Update: lyrics don't show up when casting to a Spotify connect device!",negative
No idea why the playlist search function doesnt allow you to find songs or artists in your playlists. Seems a basic functionality that should be there,negative
Unable to play podcasts. When played app closes instantly.,negative
why remove the feature to listen to some bits of a song when adding songs to ur playlist?? why?,negative
Great App. Love the content and easy of use,positive
"Wish there was a cheaper option.$9.99 a month just to be able to skip more, replay, and skip backwards is ridiculous.",negative
I prefer this app to others. I like to collaborate with friends but I think I most enjoy the recommendations that come from the playlists that are set up by spotify. I have found a ton of new music since switching over.,positive
Podcast recommendations i cannot get rid of. The home screen is useless now,negative

Constantly stops or needs restarting,negative
"I don't like the new update because I can't skip songs, I can't drag in timestamps and this app suddenly add songs that I didn't put in my playlist.",positive
"Recent update, the now playing doesn't come on reliably. Ear pods lose functionality unless I restart it. Please fix this. Google Pixel 6 Pro",negative
"Pretty glitchy, I always have some issue. Sometimes the song doesn't show up, it things I have no internet when I do, song doesn't change on my screen when it's playing on a different device and am still connected to the device. Poor effort when paying premium.",negative
"Until recently, I could play any song of my liking, no problem. But since the past couple of months spotify is not allowing me to play songs like I want, I can't skip more than 6 times in an hour and I can't manually fast forward the song either. I've tried to make a new account, I've uninstalled and reinstalled but nothing has worked. I don't want to delete this app but unless this gets fixed, I will delete it.",negative

"It works perfectly except for 1 thing. I have a premium plan but whenever i go to my plaulist and press shuffle, it says ""youve discovered a premium feature"". Thats all fun and games but when i select another playlist it works fine.",positive
Because of the song has enjoyable and there's a lyrics to make read and sing,positive
Nice,positive
"Has been good for the past 4 years I've been using it, but recently it'll play random songs that aren't in my Playlist and aren't similar to the genre at all, will skip songs without me hitting the skip button, close the app without me doing anything, or just won't play songs at all. Please fix this. I will be switching to a different streaming service for now",negative
They are still missing certain songs. Especially if you like the remixed version. Searching for songs can be a pain sometimes. I wish they had a search by lyrics option.,negative
Very easy to use and easy to switch over to another device.,negative
I can't search podcasts.otherwise good app.but I very sad About i cannot search or open podcast.,negative
give back the feature where you can listen to the preview of the songs before you add them to your playlist plsðŸ˜ž,negative
"Excelent! I just don't understand that, even having the latest version (auto updatings) and using it for more than a year now, I can't see the lyrics while playing the songs... Someone help me!",negative
The app open speed is so low. The app takes a huge time to load..,negative
SPOTIFY packs a punch with custom Playlist fitting your qhole day. Gr eat broadcasting and streaming function clarity. Thank you Google.,negative
Love the app. I pay for premium. It's been closing down and pausing music randomly. I'll be canceling my premium this week.,negative
Best stations and best selection can always find what I want and introduces me to so much more,positive
Im loving every single feature of the app,positive
"Pretty much unusable unless you have Spotify premium, 4-6 ads every 3 songs, plays random songs that you've never seen in your life even though you clicked your ""liked"" playlist, I'd rather pirate music and risk getting arrested",negative
Awesome need to keep this up,positive
The ads are really annoying but the sound quality and the amount u have to choose to listen to are really good. All in all not bad.,positive
Where the hell has the queue button gone?! Please bring this back,negative
Too many ads spotify is the best app to listen free ads,positive

"Nice app have all songs you want,i enjoy music here just don't want that premium adds in middle of playlist.",negative
please make it available for through prepaid payment so that easier for those who don't have credit card especially student like me. over all its super good and working just fine for me.,positive
"Spotify first did not hide music I wanted to listen to at Easter time that another service said it couldn't find anything, though it had an hour earlier. The mix of tunes it is providing is right where I like it.",positive
I'll drop down on Spotify but the Play store wouldn't let me so so the Play store apps they need to fix this now ðŸ¤¬,negative
Too many ads but with premium it's good.,positive
"I'm an Spotify user since many years. Never faced any problem but now I'm not able to share my lyrics !! My device is completely based on Android 12 , and the app is up to date !! Please look into âš ï¸",positive

When i buy premium.. always no connection even though i always using wifi for play the spotify..... please fix this,negative
Very very good app for podcasts listeners and music lovers,positive
I don't like the Spotify anymore because it's shuffling it's own and I don't know how to remove it.,negative
Now playing bar continues to disappear and becomes unresponsive to ear bud touch controls,negative
I have premium subscription but I don't know why each song I played keeps on skipping and jumping for no reason as if I'm playing the song through CD Player in a bumpy road.,negative
This app is good I play all song without ads but i buy the premium membership,positive
New update is very buggy can't skip or see what song is playing,positive
"Excellent, Spotify just keeps on getting better!!",positive
AWESOME! Best music quality especially when you are playing a song on repeat for more than ten minutes on all the other music apps I've had will start to make the song burn up 10 out of 5,positive
"Very buggy, regularly crashes in the last week",negative
"App crashes, no play bar, unable to play music. Starting to fail as of recent. Has been issue for a week.",negative

"I love it so much !!! Only 1 problem, when im driving and there's a place with no internet service. The app dosen't work.It would be cool if it worked too :(",negative
"The app is amazing! I use it for every hour of the day, my playlist is over 24 hours. But i wish there were more skips!",negative
"Dear Spotify, I have cancelled my subscription and you kept debiting me . This is unfair",negative
Cancellation is hard and it no longer has the option to listen to small snips of the song to make sure it was the one you were looking for or sounds like something you would like to add to your playlist. If you are going to make changes to an app atleast make the app better not worse!,negative
"Such a glitchy app, lags like crazy (displays incorrect songs frequently due to this). Expected so much more from a brand like Spotify. Update 5/2022 the network connectivity of this app is dire, have to force it to close constantly when travelling for it realise there's a connection - even get the no network connection whilst the app is working and connected. As I've said before, expected so much more from this brand when actually the experience is really poor. Have to reboot to see now playin",negative
It was good but there's some songs that are not there but I like but it's okay because the songs are still there some of the songs that I like!!.,positive
"Spotify is messed up, none of my devices playlist are linked up, the app doesn't work properly(can't see the song currently playing to be able to skip ahead, etc,...)",negative
Add songs feature is broken and doesn't let me preview a song before adding like it used to.,negative
Love spotify! Great music choices!,positive
music keeps cutting out,positive
"Have to force stop and clear cache about twice a week now, very buggy for what it is. It also hates to cooperate with it's matching app on the galaxy watch. Update 11/04/2022: Instead of those issues being fixed we got new bugs. Music playback stops constantly for no reason. App fails to load on many occassions. Closing all apps on android crashes the app, this doesn't happen with other music apps. Media controls often require multiple key presses before working. Downloads run only if open",negative
Honestly I never was big into using a music app I mostly downloaded all my music and paid for it but then when I found out you could steal it for free I was super happy but then it was illegal and it made me sad but the fact that Spotify come through clutch s*** boy make you want to slap your mama,negative

Best place for podcast listen all the time,positive
"Terrible app. i have used this app for years to come but now I have to pay to listen and choose my songs now because my ""14 day trial"" has ended, this is just a big pay to listen app and it adds stuff fi dont want in my playlist and removed alot of stuff that you could use for free to premium users only. Old spotify was better,SoundCloud and YouTube here I come!",negative
I love Spotify to death but the new lyrics feature will not work and it's forgetting on my nerves Spotify fix yourself,negative

Love it. Very happy with my music.,positive
It is cool ,positive
"Still plays suggested songs not in playlist or album. If I selected a particular album (made by the original artist) or a playlist I created, why do you keep playing random songs that are not included??? It's annoying.",negative
"I have no words to praise what a excellent music app there,s no one who compete this fabulous music master.",negative
I enjoy the music selection as well as having limited advertising to interrupt the flow.,positive

Got to fix ur premium cause i can't listen to music offline,negative

Giving 4 start Bcoz i didn't found all the songs which I wanted. But overall best app for songs and clearity of the songs is awesome.. Premium membership is too good.,positive
Music is awesome!! Joe Rogan podcast is the only reason I downloaded this app because you sponsor him and he is my dad,negative
This app very well,positive
Very good music excellent to listen to . A fantastic variety of music to choose from,positive
I got premium a month ago and the audio output SUCKS! The volume is so low even at the highest setting and i thought something was wrong with my earphone but the same song played on Amazon music was much louder and far better.,negative

The problem is in the app. So please help me in solving my problem. Thank you Shubham",negative
Easy to use. Plenty of songs and artists to choose from.,positive
Stop forcing podcasts to be exclusive. Nobody wants to be forced into your service. I was on the fence about trying Spotify but now I will not.,negative
l love Spotify,positive
I wish spotify stations was still available it was way easier to use,negative
Spotify exceeded my expectations. No wonder my whole family uses Spotify!,positive
The reduce star is just because I can't see the lyric together with the song. I truly like how diverse the choices of songs are.,positive
Sabse best aap for music..no add only music ðŸŽµ very happy for this aap,positive
"Ok finally it improved a bit,what I loved about this app is its Logarithm,like it suggests you best songs on the basis of what you're hearing now but now they're decreasing it ,it was one of the major reason i bought it's subscription,hope they improve it,ðŸ¤”",positive
"App no longer shows album tracks and I can't play the album in album order, it's always on shuffle, an app playing music so be so easy why make it so frustrating ðŸ˜ , looking for alternatives now",negative
"I love this app a lot!!! All you have to do is look up the song and there is no adds, and it comes in clearly! I use it all the time. Love it. ðŸ˜ðŸ˜",positive
7 ads in one go that's too much,negative
Okay when signed up to the app on a monthly contract. When using it for free the number and length of advets has increased considerably from when Spotify first started.,positive
Love love love the music and that you can share your Playlist with your friends! ðŸ¤©ðŸ’•ðŸ’–ðŸ’¯,positive
I hate how you can't pick your own song and how it picks for you,negative

"Overall, never had any issues with this app so I got nothing negative to say.",negative
"I deleted all my other music apps after they sided with the first amendment and took down Neil ""the sheep"" Young's music (at his own request). Neil Young= ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ His music blows anyway",negative
"If there was a 0 star , I would have give that . This app is horrible . Trash garbage and everything . You can skip only 6 songs per hour . These limits are fricin suck",negative
"Absolutely terrible. One aspect made me rage so much and start punching things once I saw, whenever you search a song, click it or put it in a playlist, IT WILL PLAY EVERY SONG BUT THAT ONE. YOU LITTERLY NEED PREMIUM TO SKIP TO THE NEXT SONG. HOW MONEY HUNGRY CAN COMPANIES GET? WE TRULY LIVE IN THE WORST GENERATION",negative
"Love Spotify, couldn't imagine my life without it...:)",positive
This app is really good and helpfull for mind freshness,positive
"When playing the song it's very good because of the audio quality but what I don't like is that the song plays randomly, it can't be repeated when the song continues. And also I just want to play a song while doing homework why do I have to go to a premium account?",positive
"Love Spotify. I switched from Pandora and I'm infinitely happier with what I have now. Highly recommend. I never had the free with adds version, but for me it's worth every penny to get the music I want.",positive
For me is the best music streaming app especially if you have the premium,positive
"Amazing app, the best for podcasts and streaming. A must have.",positive
Love spotify!!! Has every song and artist you could think of. Recommendations are great! Really makes you feel more connected with the band or artist as well!,positive
"Very buggy on Galaxy S22. After playing something, the play band/navigation doesn't show up and thus can't switch output devices.",negative
"Spotify has an incredible song selection and great user interface but this last update has made it a nightmare. Constantly bugging out, closing, play bar disappearing, and pausing itself with no way to resume content. Was a 5 star super app before this but this sucks.",negative
"It's kinda weird on when I was trying to listen to a long Playlist it was like ""YoU fOUnd A pReMeIUM FeatUre"" and didn't tell me what the freaking feature was. And when I clicked it again it just said it again with not even playing it. I'm going back to YouTube.",negative
Great for music,positive
Everything is good except that they removed my favorite song which is Swallowing dust by National radio,positive
"I used to love spotify. Blabbed to everyone I knew about how great it was. Then I found out they are all about WOKE and the socialist agenda. Welp, that ain't for me. So it's getting flushed right along with what it supports.",negative
The best for listening songs,positive
"It is great, and although there are still things to improve you can see they hear the user and improve what they need.",positive
"Spotify refuses to pay artists fairly. Switch to Tidal, they have better audio quality anyways.",negative
I liked it before they started updating it I couldn't press any music and have to shuffle to press the playlist it used to be so fun but now I'm thinking of switching it or just doing something about it.,negative
The app says to watch a short video and enjoy 30 minutes of uninterrupted music. Two songs later and you have to listen to five ads before hearing your third song. There is no such thing as 30 minutes of uninterrupted music using Spotify.,negative
All the songs you love!ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,positive
Mediocre Android experience. Developers don't care to implement basic QoL features from iOS like swiping to add to queue EDIT: Thank you for adding swipe to queue for Android. Upped to 4 stars,negative

I like this very much because favorite all songs are here . I am giving 5 star ðŸŒŸðŸ˜,positive
Very goodit has many different types of songs,positive
App seem a bit broken on the newest Android os. In my car it suddenly starts playing even if I had exited the app 10min before that. Other app is also having difficulty to get audio through since Spotify is not giving away its position as the main player for some reason.,negative
It's starting to feel like a podcast platform rather than a music platform. Should pay artists better.,negative
The best music application there is.,positive
Love this app! Can find most of what I want on here.,positive
Redoing the play button skip n rewind leaving them unorganized was dumb af. That alone is gonna make me unsubscribe. Why mess with a good thing smfh,negative
"I love this app! Found musiÃ§ that I've been looking for for years - and compiled playlists according to my tastes. Easy to use, even for me.....somewhat elderly, to put it politely. I recommend this app.",positive
Please bring back the dragable slider in your liked songs!!!,negative

"Nice music,clear recording good sounds to hear",positive
Music keeps playing with no controls to stop it. Very annoying and often embarassing. Spotify is going the way of Winamp and Blockbuster.,negative
Best music & podcast App hands down,negative
Spotify is the best app for listening music it has all the features I have never seen before ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„âœŒï¸,positive
"Way too much ads. Okay I understand the benefits of buying premium but that doesn't mean I have to watch an unskippable ad after every song. Downloaded this app with excitement, no excitement left now.",negative
Always ads coming in between the songs... Worst app...,negative
Its nice to use premium but sometimes when I have a playlist downloaded sertain songs will undownload them selves and stuff. If that could ve fixed I will be very happy and make my rating a 5. Thank you.,negative
"Unuseable in current state. Play bar is missing from the app. Over 4 years this has never happened. Thread on your support page told me to update app, no change. Please fix this.",negative
The app works just fine and am enjoying it and no unnecessary ads,positive
"Spotify removed my progress bar... so how do I skip, shuffle, repeat or pause a song? I can't. They call this progress? If it isn't broke don't fix it. The app was good.",negative
To many commercials I can't listen to 2 songs without 4 commercials before and after. Bye Felicia!,negative

A really good and affordable platform to stream musicðŸ‘Œ,positive
"Spotify's CEO is supporting Heckler, a military company. I strongly condone this! --- Other then that, he lyrics are not showing in my app at all. I've tried logging in and out, deleting and reinstalling the app, deleting the cache and all the data - nothing works. It has to do something with my account - when I logged in with a friend's account, the lyrics were shown. Spotify customer support were not helpful.",negative
"Personally, I think it's the best app to listen to music to. But it includes too many advertisements and adds unwanted songs.For example, I removed a song off my playlist and it was automatically re-added.",negative
"Everything works just fine, built a real good app",positive
App keeps getting stuck and I constantly have to restart it,negative
My experience with spotify is great so far I wish all of the songs had lyrics but I can overlook that small inconveniences because it does the rest of it's job as close to perfectly as I can imagine,positive

"It is constantly opening on it's own and auto playing whenever I connect to my car via Bluetooth. I can shut the app down. I can go into the app, stop music and then close the app, and STILL it always auto plays!! It's beyond annoying! 4/26/2022 It STILL auto plays every single time or connects to my car! I preferred this app over Pandora bc of the playlists and podcasts, but now that Pandora has those, I'm considering switching back! IT'S ANNOYING!!!!",negative

I love it there's not much adds either all music is free and it's free to make a podcast,negative

If you want to listen to music this is the one,positive
Video never works. Always crashes and just doesn't work properly. My podcast will cut out and start over randomly. I love when it randomly loses my place and what I'm listening to and plays something else. Boggles my mind that people actually pay monthly for this app,negative
Bad app to many adds and always an add about spotify premium,negative
Love it! Use it for all my music listening and podcasts!,positive
"Used to love this but nowadays the app has become buggy, player stays in notification even after i close the app, i have to reopen it then close it to remove the notification. Music randomly pauses sometimes and i don't know why canavs feature is not available in India even after 2 years of it's launch.",negative

"I used to love this app. but now you've completely ruined the experience with your updates and re-crafting. It's complete and total garbage now. If your trying to shed users, to go to a pay to play format, you've only half the formula right.",negative
Spotify should be able to download on Mac but its not,negative
Terrible... Cuts off every half a song! Worst app ever... Started off good then they updated it and now its horrible... Was going to pay Â£10 a month for this aswell but now wont bother,negative
The best App for music lovers you can find.,positive

I wished that on my phone I can click a song and play the full song not a preview of it also to not have everything be a shuffle play through and to have it to play in order not shuffle. Other then that the app is good,negative
Spotify is great for listening to albums. And it's cool to be able to make playlists.,positive
No microphone icon to enable voice control. Needs an update?,negative
I know ads are the cost to free use And yes thats all right But 3 ads straight back to back Like for 1 and a hlaf minutes sometimes Don't you think that's a little much ? And even the volume increases just for the Ads.,negative
Nice default playlist and best beat production,positive
"I was logged back into Spotify, but someone rubbish named Mick D was not taken off my home section because I had previously selected it by mistake. Please can you remove it? âŒâŒâŒâŒâŒ Stormzy â­âŒâŒâŒâŒ Party Rock Anthem â­â­âŒâŒâŒ AC/DC",negative

Keep needing to restart the app because the play controls disappear. Also it lags. Having the same issue as Laura B,negative
"The latest update is FLAKEY - sometimes the playback controls are there, sometimes they aren't.

"So good for music and other things, yes there are ads, but theres also spotify premium.ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰",positive
I have been using like 4 years sound quality and loading works fairly but the problem is any music playlist I play it repeats 4 to 5 songs reapeatly please repair the bug. And please try to show less ads for the listeners who cannot afford premium account.,negative
A very amazing app. really helpful on stress full days,positive
All my favourite music in one place,positive
This app is good but the major problem is that when I logged in I tried to play my playlist and it was on shuffle I tried to fix it but it didn't work. It is very frustrating that I can't even listen to something I want to in order. PLEASE tell me what to do to get rid of it or fix it or Spotify lost someone for their app.,negative
"Full of problems. Constant connectivity issues, constantly forgets my saved music. Often won't load. Often won't play music that's even downloaded. The amounts of times I am aging a song and halfway through it just stops or crashes with no excuses. Time to try something else not worth the money.",negative
"I download podcasts because I have spotty connections. So podcasts is in phone, but if it tries to play an ad while I have a bad connection it hangs until I get a connection, then plays the ad. Then it dumps the currently playing podcast, loses its place meaning the podcast flips to viewed and progress bar is gone. Then starts a completely different podcast. Then I'm spending 5-10 minutes figuring out where I was in the original. I love the podcasts this bug sucks.",negative
Why can't I clear the app once I finished with it anymore? The app stays open till it decides it wants to close now,negative
Bro the ads r so annoying this app is v good if you have premium but other then that it's very to use. I just wish for mobile ver i don't have to listen to a whole playlist for one song,negative
Huge selection of music; the best app for creating playlists!,positive
Tooooo much ads,negative
Worst app ever... I am clicking on the song which i want to listen but any other song is being played every time.,negative
"Pretty great selection, very eclectic.",positive
Y experience is really nice while using this application thanks for making this sor tof application,positive
"guts, click the permissions tree before downloading this app, it collects your personal phone number, emails, pictures voice data, gestures used, AND stores it on a probably hackable server using its quote unquote secure transmissions but they wont elaborate on how its transferred or anything. DO NOT DO IT guys, we are all on YT music (Youtube music, red and white pic) or soundcloud lately. More news to come later, i think a boycott is in-order gentlemen....!@!",negative
Very nice app even though we close the app songs are playing.,positive
This app has all my songs I like yay!,positive
I love sitting around with friends and we make new playlist when together.,positive
I love the selection of playlists and being able to build my own.,positive
Spotify is all and more than I could want for my musical exploration and enjoyment.,positive
Best,positive
"Good, but you shouldn't take away from people who have a voice on your platform.",positive
This is the best music platform! Unlimited music anytime. I.love it!,positive
The new update sucks. You can't play any song you want. It was better before until the developers put play any song in premium & now you can only play music using shuffle mode. Please put the play any song back in free rather than on premium. T _ T,negative
"Love Spotify , it sounds awesome in my car.",positive
Spotify has a great variety of content and gives the listener the ability to curate their experience to their own personal tastes. The app works great.,positive
Lot of ads,negative
i like this app but it closes and the music stops playing when i open other apps which is annoying,negative
Wow,positive
Exceptional...in lone with the playlists prescribed ...,positive
Great selection of classic period music from the sixties ...,positive
"Music is the best and when there is a platform that makes it so easy to listen to it, it's great.",positive
It is using too much battery life on my pixel 6 for some reason even if I am doing background listening of already downloaded songs. Otherwise I really like Spotify app over youtube music even though it doesn't have some of the punjabi songs available.,negative
Have used many different services but Spotify is still one of the best. Tons of features and good layout. Just wish you could upload your own music but that is a rare feature.,positive
"Doesn't play the albums I click on, can't view albums properly, useless skip limits, intrusive ads.",negative
Outstanding quality of sound....and affordable!!!,positive
Play 9 seconds and stop. Uninstalled.,negative
Great selection and easy to use.,positive
You have a wonderful app I pay for the premium subscription the only thing you guys need to do is try to find more Underground Music and there are some tracks that iHeart have that you guys don't update the music library,positive
I have given 4 stars because I don't get lyrics of all the songs and also because of ads. I want the lyrics. Bit I don't get them only,negative
Ads interrupt the flow of the music. No likey,negative
I love using it its easy simple and has a lot of the music and podcasts I love thank you spotify!!!,positive
Reduse some ads,negative
App seems to automatically pause if my screen lock goes on when in car. I've had two instances where someone else I don't know managed to attach their account to mine. Songs I've added to Playlists have disappeared and Playlist themselves have vanished.,negative
It worked; but I am not sure about the controls. I like Spotify.,negative
"Latest update is s**t. Currently playing bar disappears or shows as not playing. Unable to pause, skip, etc. Premium subscription service obviously means nothing to Spotify's quality team. Very disappointed that an app with so many paid users is updated/released without proper testing.",negative
Used to be great app but now it won't even let me open the options for a song or a album without crashing don't bother downloading this app if u want to be able to make playlist,negative
"I listen to mostly pod cast stories. When I choose a program, it's really frustrating that spotify can't remember what I have already played without having to go to the ""sort"" and select the unplayed and oldest to newest option every time I open the app.",negative
"Started using spotify on mobile and shocked by my experience. I have had multiple errors that support have tried ""fixing"" but none of it worked I have had random songs being added to my playlist that don't show up In the playlist with autoplay off. I have also got told to get Spotify Premium because the app won't let me skip even though I haven't even used any of my skips. Another problem Is the amount of ads. I had 5 adverts which really pissed me off. No wonder why I use an ad blockers on PC.",negative
App keeps crashing. Had to cancel my subscription and uninstall hope that it gets fixed bc I like it but don't like it crashing while listening to music as I skip to the next track,negative
What's with the automatic pausing?,negative
Great spotify music,positive
"It was good for a long time. But it started to lag and play randomly. I will be deleting this app. I updated it, restarted my phone and everything.",negative
It is all good but when I am playing a song it just shuts down and the app closes. I tried uninstalling and everything but it's just not supporting.,negative
This app is amazing... Can get any song you can think of... And best experience too.,positive
Too many ads,negative
"Awesome app ! The music is of great quality and has wide variety. There are also a variety of podcasts to listen to, and a few personal specks that make for a great listening experience. If you don't have a premium account it can be a bit frustrating to use, but still wonderful - I definitely recommend !",positive
Good ,positive
Can you pls stop putting stupid songs in my playlist. And you sad 30 min but after 2 songs ads,negative
There isn't a free to use version in Korea. What a rip off.,negative
"I wanted to skip songs, but it only lets you skip 6.",negative
By far the best app for listening to music and podcasts. I just LOVE it... Really easy to use itâ€˜s unlimited features.,positive
I can listen to the music I prefer.,positive
Why they hell am I getting pop-up ads when I pay you for ad free?,negative
"Normally I adore spotify. But it has been bugging out for the past month. I am constantly having to restart the app to change songs. The whole song bar will disappear. Sometimes when i have no internet, i cant get into my DOWNLOADED playlists!!! Also, I even deleted the app and downloaded it again. Still not better. Please fix the bugs! Thank you.",negative
I am not able to cancel my subscription plan. It's displaying something went wrong.,positive
The app keeps disconnecting at random all the time.,negative
When I say hey Spotify it doesn't work,negative
Please enlarge player control and lyrics frame as it was before. thanks,positive
"I love to use Spotify but now days this ""Chand baliyaa"" advertising....it's make me angry. When it's say that for 30 minutes I'll not get any advertising but only after 1 or 2 song I'm getting advertising again n again so do something otherwise everyone will just hate that ""Chand Baliyaa"" song for sure. Thank you.",negative
I love the app and the music. Only thing is I have a paid subscription. All my downloads want to show up but most of the songs says they are not downloaded. It has me going back and forth on wifi. It is pretty anoying.,negative
Good,positive
Listening adds more than music,positive
The app is quite good and has many songs available. Bur recently i have been facing problems with using it. When i want to search for a song it tells me to go online even though i am connected to wifi. Please fix this problem i really like this app and its amazing.,positive
Stupid app won't let me play certain specific songs it's always on shuffle play without premium,negative
Trash app all I listen whole day is just add,negative
"The only reason i give 4 stars is because yall keep adding songs to my playlist like bruh, i wanna listen to songs i like stop doing that shi everyday i gotta hide songs yall added to my playlist to listen to my songs that shi is annoying",negative
Wonderful music of about every genre. I even decided to name my puppy Eno after discovering the music of Brian Eno.,positive
App is constantly crashing and doesn't play songs anymore.,negative
When i first downloaded Spotify it was a solid experience. Most of the features they offered worked well and the algorithm they were using to recommend me new music was fantastic. As of the last year or so it has gradually got worse. To the point now that it is nearly unusable. From connections issues with Bluetooth devices too one of the worst offline modes i have ever used. Even simple things like podcasts playlists that will play previously played podcasts before unplayed ones.,negative
Once again Spotify isn't working properly. Sort it!,negative
Love the wide variety of music available and the ability to create my own Playlist.,positive
I pay fro premium and recently I have had adverts playing. Why????,negative
I like the app most instead of other apps but I'm giving 4 stars because of too many adds about Spotify premium but it's ok .. this ismy favourite music app ever â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,positive
"I love music, I also is really nice to listen to when just needing to to rest and laying down.",positive
Not working well after latest update. I have the same problems as everyone else.,negative
"I thought at first you would have to buy a Premium Version of this app to get everything, but I'm getting all the Music, Podcasts and Playlists that I wanted and I've been able to download it with ease. An all round great app!",positive
"Improve audio quality, Sometimes Spotify Lagging.",negative
It is a nice app but I can't add my other favourite artists so I had to give 4 stars but I really love this app.,positive
Not show on phone can't stop music play I had turn my phone off turn back on make music stop,negative
I really enjoy Spotify over Pandora.....,positive
Love the Spotify they have all the music I love,positive
"Why am I seeing ads? I paid for a premium plan but when I listen to podcasts, I notice two very long 30 sec advertisements. I do not like this! The reason I left pandora and came to Spotify was because of the no advertisements. Please take this away... 5 stars other than that.",negative
"With so many updates this app went through and still acting the same, there a problem with that I can't automatically play a music when im paired with Bluetooth, I have to go to the actual app and play musics, its so super annoying..........",negative
"It A Gud App But You Can,t Put Your Fav Music In A Loop Without Buyying It But Im Broke No We Are *Yaws* Hope We Can Do It On A Loop For Free. X]",negative
"Amazing app....but still far from perfect. Many songs in regional languages are not available, improvement is needed in that regard.",negative
It's good at creating interesting playlists but lacks some good songs.,negative
Always a great playlist,positive
Worst app in the world I am already online and this app says you are offline. Not able to use this app. Guide me how to cancel premium subscription.,negative
"Honestly, my only issue is there is no way to REMOVE and UNDOWNLOAD individual songs. I.E. discover weekly. I can hide an individual song, but it still is downloaded and still pops up in my daily mixes etc. It sucked. Thats why i hid it. Let it disappear and never show up again ffs",negative
Premium user here. Its been showing that no internet connection when in fact there is. Whats going on,negative
I love the app it's def all in 1 all around listening magic machine,positive
"Spotify is expectionally good, but I feel there are still areas left for improvements, like fresh song recommendations based on one random song.",negative
This app is very good i love it,positive
Funny my review was erased. Again been with Spotify a long time but am going to end the premium due to app keeps stopping and starting by itself. Can't even listen to a whole podcast without issues. Why pay Joe Rogan millions but can't even have a decent running app. It did not use to be like this.,negative
"Trash you cant pick the song you want to hear instead have to hope the random selection will get the song you want. Pay the same price for youtube music and get everything from the artis, don't buy into spotify limitations.",negative
I've been enjoying this app so much. It makes listening to music easy!!!,positive
I can't listen my liked songs because of too many different songs that i don't want to listen an i can't even skip them.,negative
Cool apps music,positive
I can find almost anything I want to listen to.,positive
Way better than those other music/radio apps.,positive
"Nothing to complain, the app is clean and easy to use, but hopefully the have promo's for the long term subscribers as i have subscribe a few years. ðŸ˜˜",negative
"Very nice ,and the lyrics are accurate",positive
It have very nice Playlist,positive
"Downloaded music won't play without an internet connection. It used to, which allowed me to listen at work, but not anymore.",negative
"Honestly, it was great for a long while. But once the monthly thing ended, it was torture, especially the 6 skips per hour. In conclusion I'll say it was good...until time ran out",negative
Why can't I pause or stop a song from playing? This is ridiculous. I literally have to restart my phone to get the songs to stop playing. FIX THIS!!!!,negative
"Update: They brought back the âªâ¯â© AND driving mode. ðŸ’™ðŸ˜ â€¢ 3/'21: Love Spotify. Had it for many years on PC. Would give 5 â˜†s if Spotify would include itself and the âªâ¯â© buttons on the drop down notification bar on Androids for quicker access to them like it used to. It was b/c of this feature that I deleted other apps. Having to minimize all apps to reopen Spotify app, and then reopen the track just to get the âªâ¯â© menu is a bummer... I need this feature back please.",negative
Best choice if you can't live without music,positive
"I like the app but sometimes when I close the cover of my phone or when my screen goes off the app stops playing music, I don't know if I have to set it somewhere or if it's a in-app issue.",negative
My translator disappeared and also there's no karaoke option,negative
I can't pause or click next on my basic Spotify plan ðŸ˜­ Please fix!,negative
"Usually don't have any issues but lately when I move songs in the queue, they revert back to their old position. Real glitchy and unresponsive since update yesterday. Pixel 5.",negative
Good music platform,positive
K VISION PUBLISHING ASCAP,positive
I absolutely love Spotify. There are so many choices for music lovers to choose from. Thank you!!,positive
The reason for 1 star is because you will not allow me to upgrade to the family option and try to force me to pay for each individual account. Only because i am already a customer. Way to treat your loyal listeners. Pathetic really.,negative
"Excellent app, Happy that I can hear my local Konkani songs unlimited.",positive
Very good and simple,positive
"Love the service, using the app when i actually want to works flawlessly. but the app has 1 big issue for me. It tries to open spotify and play my local audio files when i open them outside the app. and is making it impossible to play them with the app installed. I have it set to not have permission for local files but it reads them anyways.",negative
"Love it!! (4/30/22) Keeps crashing and everything I've tried to fix it, hasnt. Seems to be crashing on Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connectionws. (11-12-21) amazing! Still amazing!! (4-18-20)",positive
"Horrible in the beginning it was great but now it won't play the songs on my library, if I choose the song I want to listen it won't play it, it rather plays a random song ...what's going on Spotify fix it now...and I can't even download songs to listen off line",negative
"The latest update is causing the app to randomly pause on its own and cause the now playing bar with play/pause to disappear. Transitioning from phone audio to Bluetooth, Android Auto, or Chromecast frequently cause audio to stop working. A song will be playing, but you won't be able to hear it. When using Android Auto and streaming music, anytime a phone call comes in it causes the audio to not return once the phone call is done. I have to unplug my phone and plug it back in to get it to work.",negative
Seriously Spotify u don't have proper shuffling for multiple playlist in queue. I guess it's time'to move on from Spotify. Really awful.,negative
"Only music app I use. It's great! Sometimes the adds can get annoying, but that can easily be bypassed with premium. All in all I love it!",positive
It's is wonderful to have access to music at anytime and by your favourite artist. It is so clear and great. Just completely love it.,positive
Most amazing and best media music app you can play music offline download have your own music files extremely easy to navigate,positive
I'm getting really annoyed by the algorithms that keep playing the same songs over and over again on shuffle when I have a much larger variety in the playlist.,negative
"Spotify is bs. Pandora is better because atleast doesn't have a limit on FREE. Your ads were on a loop for a while. If you think I'm gonna pay with money I don't got and try a trap me with loops of ads.... then not only is this a shifty app, it's getting reported everyday. Don't like it, don't con people.",negative
Very good and easy to use app.All songs are available here.,positive
App is good but after resent update i can't login.,negative
"Pauses, skips, stutters; just utter garbage on WiFi. Happily eats my mobile data, though. I've done my research into solutions and the conclusion is the same; WiFi sucks.",negative
Stupid adds after every single song now. Forget this useless app.,negative
It keeps getting better just disappointed that I can't scroll to the letter anymore...,negative
Constant ads and will sometimes play music that is not in your playlist there are also songs by people like Kendrick Lamar that have songs that aren't on spotify horrible experience,negative
It was a beautiful song and Drew was singing the ðŸ’¯ðŸ”¥,positive
Great app but they need to fix their shuffle and fix the how radio/playlist is created seems like it put in your recent songs you listen even if genre of music is completely different which doesn't make sense,negative
Bekar app,positive
Good app works with free ads :),positive
"So damn good, but the ads are too much if u dont buy premium, like 3-5 ads",negative
A good variety of songs and oldies!!,positive
I love this app but when i try to listen to my fav song it puts something else that's why i am giving you 1 star make it ok please,positive
Highly data consume app.It is youse for audio songs app but it is consume data like i see video in some app.I thing when I see video in youtube it is consume less data.,negative
Its a good idea for people to lisen to music with no adds.,positive
Spotify as we all know was great. WAS up until this new update I can't pick songs and I thought picking a Playlist would work but nope songs I didn't even add are on it. I didn't even know this update was a thing up until I got a new phone cause on my tablet and laptop I don't have to worry about this. Literally the only reason people use Spotify is to avoid this. If we wanted to not know our next song we'd use Pandora,negative
Nice ðŸ‘ app; but you can't download the online music,negative
Keeps randomly freezing shite,negative
"Personalized listening experiences, I love the collaborative playlists!",positive
"Well designed app, great music and podcasts. I appreciate how well it is put together!",positive
By far the best platform for video & audio podcast. I'm a student so I only pay $6 a month and it's worth every penny!,positive
"Most of the time perfect. But just very lately, have noticed drop in sound quality and songs saying Spotify carnt play this song at the moment. Don't know the reason. Checked settings, they look fine. This is the reason for the 3/5. Use to be more until latest issues. Please try to fix issues, then I'll give 5/5. Because it is usually very good. Might be slight technical issue. Saturday 23.4.22. The sound quality has been improved ðŸ‘Œ. Thanks Spotify ðŸ˜Š. I recommend Spotify to anyone.",positive
Continues to add music to your Playlist very annoying,negative
No issues . No glitch. Can find music most wouldn't listen to .,positive
"It's the beat app that is out there, especially for music and podcast.",positive
"Paid for Spotify premium, so you'd expect to have no issues, however spotify tells me every month that my ""payment didn't work"" and to ""try a new payment method"" although there is money in the bank for them to take. My "" 2021 wrapped"" does not work either",negative
"I love Spotify, but lately its been running really slow and buggy. Almost unbearable",negative
Its really annoying when the music doesnt have lyrics and like 70 of the time the lyrics arent there For the free users there too many ads and you cant even play it in shuffle order The only thing I like about this app is that theres a lot of good playlists already there and there are great podcasts and it has pretty good song recommendation,positive
Songs stop playing after 9 seconds.,negative
wow,positive
Won't let me play the song I want to listen to.,positive
"Outstanding performance,audio quality is very nice and very beautiful song app.",positive
"The lyrics match up, (unlike apple music) It's nice having 1 month free, even then premiums worth the money.",positive
Been looking for something with music all day long but this;magnificent ..,positive
"I have been experiencing random shutdowns during playback and failure to display the progress bar/track info both in the app and on my lock screen for a couple months, even after a reinstall.",negative
Please refresh my channel subscribe please find attached the full amount stated that the full video like you have received 8,positive
Audio quality seems slightly less compared to Apple music,negative
Nice,positive
It's not visible in my app section and when I try to play a music it plays another one so that's why I gave it 3 star but it's such a beautiful app for song love it,positive
Continuously playing for about 60 seconds. Kindly tell us whether we wanna use this application or not. One or two ad is fine... But this is totally annoying,negative
Too many ads. Not everyone can afford Spotify premium!!,negative
Amazing get to listen to the songs u love â¤,positive
100% satisfied with this app. We can search and hear any songs and make playlist. Love this appðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»,positive
"It annoys me greatly that Daniel Ek is so rich off the back of this terrible app. It's the most buggy app I've ever had. Controls constantly disappear meaning the only way I can stop a track is to uninstall the entire app. Thankfully a family member is paying for it, not me!",negative
"Canceled paid services after several years of constant annoyance with this app. Ui sucks. Stations randomly change genres all the time, and now the app crashes every other song. This and prime are the worst of the lot, yt and pandora are hardly better. No customer support, just links to their ""community"" which is equally useless.",negative
"I liked the way it was before, I seriously hate the bew update for it, it's absolutely awful. I miss how Spotify was like a months ago. I wish they didn't update it",negative
Too much and too long ads.,negative
Unusable if you don't pay for premium. Don't bother.,negative
Too much ads like forever.,negative
"My profile doesn't even show up, and my playlists don't show up. It's been going on for months. Only the app has the problem, I can use the website just fine",positive
I love the way they go straight into the next song like it's being done by a dj,positive
For the past couple months the app is slow and unstable. It feels like I'm being robbed when I pay 144â‚¬ per year for something that barely works.,negative
I highly suggest not getting this. I have tried 3 months now to cancel my subscription. It says its canceled yet they keep taking funds from me. Try to comtact support but there isnt any human recources or human customer service. Just written suggestion... Amazon music is way better then this junk.,negative
Spotify team didn't respond or take action quick enough to rectify users complaints.,negative
Spotify please can you have a chat feature??? hshshhs i wanna that!!! ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”,negative
"Worst app for non premium users, you'll get ad after every song",negative
WHY THE HELL DOES THIS NEW UPDATE KEEP MAKING MY MUSIC PAUSE LIKE EVERY 20 SECONDS. ITS VERY ANNOYING!! I DO NOT PAY PREMIUM EVERY MONTH FOR THIS. PLEASE FIX BUG!!,negative
"This is a great app but whenever you try to play a song or playlist it is forced into shuffle, I tried to play a song but it was mixed with other songs that I didn't want to listen to, and with playlists you can't play a particular song anymore because theyre forced into shuffle which is not optional, you can't turn it off, the update that did this ruined Spotify and should be undone. Congratulations Spotify, you've ruined your app.",negative
"Ads after every 2-3 songs, that too promoting Premium, pretty irritating if you ask the people using your app. This is the reason I believe most of us are switching to other apps with better streaming. I am using MY DATA for the app, why isn't that enough? What kind of a marketing strategy is this? The only thing you've gained from the persistent advertisments is a low rating on the play store app. People aren't gonna buy premium just because you make them endure these ads.",negative
"I GAVE IT 2 STAR COZ OF ADS INTERAPTION ðŸ˜‘WAIT,I AM NOT A PREMIUM MEMBER OF SPOTIFY ,BUT WHEN I STARTED TO LISTEN MY FAVOURITE SONG ,AFTER SOMETIME A ADD COME AND IT WILL SAY THAT YOU WILL GET 30 MINUTES UNINTERRUPTED LISTING , I SAY ""OK""BUT BUT AFTER 2 OR 3 MINUTES A NEW ADD COMEðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ - I WILL MEANT THAT -WHY SPOTIFY WILL SAY THAT YOU WILL GET 30 MINUTES UNINTERRUPTED LISTING AFTER THE ADD....WHEN THE 2 ONE (ADD) IS COME AFTER 2 MINITUES ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ , IT'S HAPPENED MANY TIME.....SOLVE IT ....ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„",negative

Sad to be honest, but after multiple emails sent..i am done.",negative
"NOT ANYMORE ðŸ’” Used to like it a lot because FREE version allowed me to play LIKED SONGS without SUGGESTIONS I want to skip!! (6 skips an hour) It's already a pain not to be able to create playlists, the annual earnings are lower due to COVID. Wanted fulI version asap cause i miss so much having lots of playlists of many styles of music being 52 yrs of age. I was a teen in the 80's. Went through phases of disco, rock, punk, R & B, country, pop, etc..",negative
I had some problems with it not playing the song I wanted but I found how to fix it just go on your phone then Spotify and do the same on your TV and play one song from your TV and you can play what you want from your phone after,negative
everything costs. And the random songs being added to your playlist is annoying.,negative
I Love my Spotify ,positive
When playing music it would freeze then I would have to push play all the time. I have the premium subscription sucks when your driving and it keeps freezing. Going back to soundcloud.,negative
"Verygood catering for individual tastes n likes.treats us listeners like we are special, compiling my most played, favourites etc.jst phenomenal .",positive
Nice product,positive
"What a fantastic experience. All the music I love, where and whenever I want. If this app doesn't close I will never use Spotify again. Revert to ZERO ðŸŒŸ",positive
Alt every other minute. Auto connect to my other device. It is nightmare. They used to be the best.,negative
Ok,positive
I truly appreciate and enjoy the freedom to choose my style of music in abundance without distraction so I can just focus on therapy and relaxation music it allows me find my happy place when the world becomes a challenging place to dwell in!,positive

Modern Gospel..R&B..Country.. Modern Jazz to name a few. Thank you,positive
Phenomenal never had problems I get all y tunes free but would be better HD without a fee but can't fault it really,positive
"Now that they're getting rid of all of the stand-up comedy and trying to be a part of cancel culture, they are really not worth the price. Spotify was really amazing at one point, but now it just forces music on you that you never listen to and is canceling of losing its good artists.",positive
Great to use this aap such an amazing songs,positive
It's definitely a good but a little problem it's has only a little skips even thought you have premium and when i make my playlist the song is short,negative
"Easy to use, Playlist are a breeze with the library and suggestions.",positive
"Add a Feature in Downloading Music in Cellular and Not even if not Subscribe in Prenium and About that, maybe it should be more affordable in choosing of the any of it and include some feature if not online in offline.",negative
"I used to love this app perfectly. I understand the 30 day free trial without ads, and i understand that there need to be ads. But now that my trial ended, it also plays other music of what im not looking for. I have this rain playlist i go to sleep to, but now it plays other music that i can not fall alseep to. Please have a option to play suggested music during our playlists. Thank you.",negative
Spotify is the best. ðŸ‘,positive
All thing is well and good but you should accept rupay cards for premium membership...Indian banks don't provide visa or MasterCard until unless you take cards which can be used in other countries...so pls provide rupay cards option too,positive
"Good marketing strategy on ads which intentionally leads to use or listen to this app 30 mins. The next 30 mins. After an update or long break for usage i am unabke to open the existing account this is my 3rd account.â˜¹ï¸ðŸ‘ŽBut still i am using this app because UI is good, otherwise i would change..",positive
App is OK but I have a hard time to connect to my profile from my personal computer! The message appears on profile saying soon you'll! But it never allowed me to! So I'm somewhat pisst off of nonsense I see with Spotify!,negative
"I had to delete spotify because it wouldn't let me log in at all even tho my internet working perfectly it keeps saying ""no internet connection try again"" i've tried everything and i just deleted the app out of frustration.",negative
Well actually I have becomed my self as a premium user and now I can enjoy it.,positive

This is an very good app to listen Your favourite songs i love it It have all the songs i need to listen other people think that this is bad but it is not bad it is smooth to use and to hear,positive
I really enjoy with this facility,positive
"Terrible for music unless you pay for everything. Unlike my tablet or PC, I can choose what song I want but on phones it forces me to shuffle play and bombards me with ads every time a song ends. You can't even play other playlists properly with this ad and only get previews. Only six skips per hour which does not really happen at all on other devices. Just a money grabbing app.",negative
"I can't play songs on the background when I'm trying to open another application, but when it does, it only lasts for mins. I saw some ratings with the same issue but I still updated the app hoping that I won't experience the same but unfortunately it's not. It's really getting annoying, I hope you can fix this as hard as you can. ðŸ™‚",negative
Pretty good. I changed a few developer settings on app.. otherwise good app,positive
"The go to app when I need HQ, uninterrupted and pure sounds",negative
Better than any other music app out there. Fewer ads. More selections.,positive
Such a low quality app. Constantly jumping to a unrelated song or genre. and stupid ads. Glad I didn't subscribe. Tidal is better and actually pays the artists.,negative
"Good for a while then it started to pause randomly and not unpaise, disconnect my Bluetooth, wouldn't open.. yeah and the barade of ads.",negative
"What have you done everything worked fine two months ago. Now as soon as I connect with my Car or Play Music over my smart speaker the App freezes sometimes and I can't control what song I want to play, the volume and in my car it shows songs playing but no sound is coming out of the speakers. How hard can it be to break stuff that already worked fine",negative
"Okay. The app itself is great. The ads though, it's littered with ads. Sure, I don't mind ads, but there are too many ads for such a short listening time. My main issue is that they say that you get 30 minutes of listening after those ads, but I barely get 5 minutes, let alone 30 minutes! If they don't fix this, some people might just go to other apps like Tidal instead which isn't a good look for a company like Spotify.",negative
It's not perfect but what is. I like it best out of all the other music apps out there.. I some how got logged out and now I can't seem to log back in and i just got my family premium back on the 30th.,positive
"I love it the only thing is that I wish the UI/UX was more fluid and less boxy, and I wish that I could DISABLE lyrics instead of always having it on",negative
"Go to app for music. Easy to find new music, easy to find music you love, easy to make play lists. I do wish they would bring back the cadence running feature though. That was pretty cool...",positive
"It is the worst app ever. Doesn't have symmetry, it's slow, doesn't charge the covers, it makes a lot of cachÃ©, etc.",negative
Great music variety and few ads! Excellent!!!,positive
Love this app. By far this is the best music app. I've tryed the other most popular music apps and I keep finding my self back on Spotify,positive
"App crashes several times during a single podcast, something has gone badly wrong since update",negative
"The amount of ads is disgusting, i had to go through 6 ads, listened to 2 songs, and got ads again. On top of that, you cant even choose the music you want to specifically listen to",negative
"Awesome app, overall amazing and blows YouTube music out of the water. 10/10",positive
Great variety and an overall great platform! Don't give in to the dictatorial types.,positive
"okay I like spotify but stop adding songs to my playlist. -update 3 years later, spotify is sooo much better w premuim and tbh its so worth it",positive
I don't know what happened but I can't see the songs that I added in my play lists but in my liked songs I can see them. I'm hoping it could be fixed or it's just my problem? But this app is awesome 5 stars:)),positive
By far the best premium music service I've ever used in my life the music quality was amazing selection could be a bit better given licensing is is the only reason why they typically don't have a song and it's rare I run into it the features and functions are far more useful and abundant than any other music service I've used keep up the great work Spotify,positive
"Nice seeing some recent work for android. Swipe to queue, and love the new squiggle progressbar",positive
If your a monthly subscription you should have problems. Like the songs keep cutting of while playing. And the app drain battery fast. I'm still in my trail period but I may just cancel. 1 last thing if you have your own Playlist worh over 100+songs you will get the same rotation when you hit shuffle,negative
"After update, app gets buggy. Have to reboot phone then start it up again. Extremely annoying when I'm at work and trying to listen to music. Used to love it but now going to have rethink paying for something that occasionally works.",negative
Great experience Will upgrade to premium,positive
"Every day with Spotify, is the best way to listen to my favorite tunes!",positive
Offline when on Android autoplay,negative
I've tried all of the top music apps and I haven't been able to find another one that is as user friendly and cost effective as Spotify. So I want to thank you Spotify and I'm sure my neighbors want to as well!,positive
Why do spotify has to stop everytime after opeing instagram and scrolling??? P.s.(Song starting after 2 ads is mandatory),negative
"Spotify is awesome app for listening music but 1 give 1 star for a reason. Spotify should make account deleting more user friendly ,it is very difficult to delete multiple accounts.",negative
Absolutely perfect app,positive
"This use to be my FAVORITE app for music. However, for the past 2 weeks or so it's gone to the bottom of the list. It now glitches EVERY time I open the app when my music is playing through the car speakers. In order to get it to play again I have to restart my device I lose the song that I was listening to. This is completely unacceptable I pay for this app (I won't be next month if it's not fixed soon) I'm not using the free one.",negative
"I really enjoy using Spotify, thia app makes music anytime, anywhere.",positive
it's perfect and you can play any some you. also there's unlimited amounts of skips unlike Pandora,positive
"Increased number of ads. I get it, you can get premium, and that's why they are doing it - however, Pandora does one ad, then secession songs. Spotify is several ads, a handful of songs, several more ads. Lame!",negative
The best music app out there!,positive
"WORST APP EXPERIENCE EVER!! PLATFORM IS FULL OF RACIST NONSENSE, HARDLY WORKS, MUST BE DESIGNED BY SOME USELESS IDIOTS! Poor user experience with premium. I pay to be able to download songs to listen to offline but when offline the app now won't let you play the songs you already downloaded. App has been getting worse and worse, slower and slower these past few months and now this. I want my money back, do not use this service!",negative
"I loved the app and listening to music for a while, but now the mobile app wont even fully load. Whenever I try to open to app, It stays on the icon screen forever. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, clearing data, clearing cache, restarting my phone, restarting my networks, but nothing is working for me.",negative
Best aap to listen music,positive
Dude I hate how you can't just play one song and you can't go back on play lists you have to finish that song once you start it if you don't have any more skips this app has changed alot and I hate it,negative
This app is the best and perfect. I will rate you 100% cos you make me to hear and good in the music world. Keep it up and let us enjoy to the bream of flows.,positive
The features are great but lately the app is all glitchy. It turns itself on after I've closed the app. It won't allow me to access control of playing a current podcast. It shows another podcast instead of what I'm hearing. I've Uninstalled and reinstalled from mine and my Mom's phone 3 times in a few days. Please fix! We are Premium Duo subscribers. This is really frustrating and is causing both of us to consider finding another app to subscribe to!,negative
I find all the artists I want and their music here and it works fast so I'm enjoying it a lot I give it five stars,positive
Very good selection of songs.love it,positive
"Whenever I start a radio based off a song or artist (which is with the intention to find a NEW artist or NEW music that is related to the song/artist I'm starting the radio off of) it just creates essentially a playlist of music I've been listening to - and not even within the same genre off the song. I've realized that I haven't found any new artists or any new music, and just continuously listen to the same things over and over again which is quite depressing.",negative
"I had JUST signed up for premium for the first time, switching from another service, and the app is almost unusable it's so damn buggy. Screw this, I'm switching back.",negative
I didn't used it for months ... And now when I'm opening it it is not displaying any song or anything.... And when I'm searching for any song it's showing i have no internet connection ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸,negative
"Smooth operation, easy to use, link up with everything and everyone.",positive
It would be nice if the lyrics of songs have an option of english so that it is easy to sing if someone is foreign to that songs language Secondly there isn't an option from where i could download a single song from a playlist whenever i try to download a song the whole playlist gets downloaded,negative
Amazing app for Music,positive
Always stopping for no reason lately,negative
New update is horrible sais on my home tab that I have my old playlists and when I go to my library it's sais I have no playlists or songs this is disappointing as its been working for years and I pay premium,negative
"Love Spotify as a platform, BUT it takes 3-5 minutes to get the app running, it often doesn't play songs at all even when I'm connected to WiFi or my data is on. It glitches, sometimes the bar showing which songs are playing at the bottom of the screen just disappears entirely (meaning you can't see what is playing, fast forward, rewind, skip songs etc.) - my app is always up to date and yet I constantly have this issue. I am working with a POCO M3 Xiaomi so phone quality is not the issue.",negative
I wanna say its my favorite music service but it only works half the time now. With 5G or wifi the music will continuously stop. Hoping a new update will be out soon because it's not usable for me anymore.,negative
Would be 5 starts if we get the shuffle downloaded songs button,negative
Keeps crashing.. Maybe started after I enhanced my liked songs. Was fine all day until I tried that now it won't stop.,positive
"It's fine but why do you need to pay premium to Pick a song, It sucks because what if you find a song that you like you have to pay PREMIUM to pick it byt if you dont you have to put it into a playlist full of other Songs then you have to hope that you get it in the few skips that you got so that you can listen to it. AND ANOTHER THING, you cant even Loop a song You need to PAY To do that, Just an F.Y.I I dont type this much, SO THATS HOW MAD I AM",negative
I feel like there's a new update every other day. Whenever I got to use the app it either closes itself or just doesn't play music. Then I checked and.... surprise... another update. Sometimes I don't have the time to download the update and so I just have to be music less. So annoying.,negative
I like Spotify ,positive
Where is my enhanced feature gone it was such a good feature,positive
"i recently got premium and everytime i skip to the next song, it crashes.",negative
I like this app,positive
Just a great platform for music,positive
Not including all arabic songs Search must be in english or latin letters Changing or canceling plan is so difficult and must be done from website not from the app They don't have annual plans only monthly auto-renewed plans Limited variety of playlists,negative
Impossible to use or navigate. Seems like something that should be simple but its unnecessarily complex.,negative
"5 stars as long as they keep Joe Rogan on! I love Neal Young, but he is no longer "" Rocken in the free world "" I got his records if I feel like listening to him.",positive
"I really wish Spotify add more customisation for Profiles and Playlist. Like a background for Playlist and Profile, where we can use Gif as well.",negative
"It was good when I first got it, I could skip and go back but now my skips are limited and I can restart it. Im not paying to skip and choose a song. I'm going to a different app",negative
This app was working great until now I have not able to use it in four days stop monkeying around it comes up then shuts off if I could move my music downloads to another music app I would have done it by now I'm tired of it being on and back off again I have tried to to put Spotify premium on my phone but my android phone does not accept the pin number I'm not going to waist money on a card that doesn't work it also kept. Telling me that I had no internet connection when I was using it offline,negative
Spotify has been TERRIBLE lately. I can't go on to the app without it lagging out or closing app. When I actually am able to listen to music I am not able to add music to other playlists. I wish they could fix this.,negative
its a good app icl but its annoying when spotify adds songs to your playlist. like im trying to listen to my own music tyvm???,negative
Seriously has hands down THEE best music app known to date! Premiem is the way!,positive
Brilliant music ðŸŽ¶ and very enjoyable,positive
Me encantan los diferentes generos de Musica,positive

"Leaving reviews on Play is completely useless, but please fix this app. It keeps crashing.",negative
"Update sucks, can't view what's playing use controls.",negative
I can't recommend this app enough! Music is the way I communicate with the universe and the people around me. It's an invaluable tool especially having mental illness. Sometimes spotify is my translator.,positive
Perfect companion during long travels.. ðŸ‘ðŸ™‚,positive
Too Much of Ad's.. I'm fed up with this app.. each n wvery time 1 want to hear a song.. first i need to listen to a lenghty add.. which spoils my mood of listening to music.... hectic services.. not at all recommended.. waste app.. pls don't download n waste your time.. 0 rating,negative
"Recently become incredibly buggy. The play/pause widget dissapears regularly, the search option grays out and becomes unusable and stops for no reason multiple times. I'm paying for this service but won't be for much longer",negative
Best subscription ðŸ™Œ ðŸ‘ you get what you pay for,negative
Its 100% better then the original app uses data and works faster its so amazing i glad to say that spotify lite is way way much better,positive
"Okay. I admit the app itself is neat. But there's one, big, disgusting issue staring you in the face: its enforcement of premium. Ads are way too frequent. I'm jammin' to something one moment and then dreading the overblown ad scene of our society the next. And god, oh god, the playlist system. I can't even play LOCAL FILES without being forced to listen to COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT SONGS on an irreversible SHUFFLE with NO CONTROL over my own LOCAL FILES. It's laughable. Actually laughable.",negative
Meh,positive
Wonderful music to work by and easy to select tunes and artist that I enjoy the most. Great variety,positive
I think this is the best music app by far,positive
Best app for listening music ...,positive
This app is very easy to use and the ads also were less,negative

Wide variety of so much music available. Thanks a lot.,positive
This new update is way too buggy. The player won't show and my music keeps cutting for no reason. Please fix soon.,negative
Always satisfied with Spotify and have been subcribe to them for over 3 years now. Subscription is worth it!,positive
This app is great except when my playlists are unavailable when they have been downloaded with the premium service? Super irritating and makes you ask the question why you're paying in the first place. Other than that it's one of the best apps when it works.,positive
"Good music but too much advertising (30 sec)every after a song, and a bad laoding.",negative
Constantly crashes while on the app! Don't ever think about having it run the background as soon as you do you'll be restarting/rebooting the app EVERY SINGLE SONG. Horrible app.,negative
I love the broad variety of the music selection. It's rare for them to not have the songs you're looking for. Definitely a worthy add.,positive
Latest update doesn't work properly. The play controls vanish and you need to restart the app to get them back.,negative
Best app for music discovering. The ads are a bit unpleasant,negative
"Edit: they patched spotify to encourage users to buy premium, otherwise free version is pandora clone. Premium is worth it tho.",positive
"Full of glitches these days. I often spend alot of time making a queue of songs, only to scroll up and find it hasn't registered it and all that effort was a waste of time. And you can't view your library in any logical order, like alphabetically. It's decent for music availability, but really annoying functionally",negative

"Spotify is nice and I have my favorite playlists on there. However, the ads can get unbearable and I used to be able to pick my songs without premium. And now I can't anymore, please Spotify don't make that just a premium thing. I can deal with ads but I hate having to listen to a song because I only have 6 skips. I like being able to pick the songs I'm in the mood for.",negative
Idk it's only with me or anybody else but one song name mar jaoge is not playing fully instead of that there is a skit before that and the song after that is not full . Do something about that guys hope you will fix that ty sm .,negative
Your premium is nice ,positive
My Spotify app is so hanging plz checkout the problem plz,negative
"Frequently songs are getting stuck in between, this is happening especially after start using premium plan",negative
I liked it because it has amazing songs,positive
"Does exactly what it's supposed to do, play music.",positive
I liked the Spotify that let me see the songs I had in my playlist.,positive
Needs to have shuffling then it would be amazing and would be rated 5 stars,positive
Very nice. I can always find what I am looking for! I use Spotify often.,positive
"Would be 5 but a lot of issues. The app was working perfectly fine but after using it for a while it started to slowly get more and more buggy/glitchy, i use play music on my xbox and use my phone to change the music but now it doesn't even show the same songs or it wont play the song i click unless i add it to queue and skip. A lot more issues but I don't want this too get too long.",negative
this app is extremely hard to use its so frustrating i cant even play the song i want even thats complicated Checking and playing songs in a playlist is difficult whenever i search a song and tap play it plays a different song then it just continues with the same song if i try to play a different song,negative
Most recent update makes the app essentially unusable! Absolutely ridiculous.,negative
"Terrible UX in this app. And to top that off most of the time searching a song and hitting play triggers an ad, and once you sit through that BS, it just plays an entirely different song. You had one job.",negative
"Latest update has broken the app. Everytime I open the app, the playback bar simply disappears. Notification doesn't work. Music plays erratically. Fix please!!!",negative
This is a best app for music playing and the ðŸŽ¶ a song,positive
too much ads. don't tell me to switch to premium. don't have a card for it.,negative

Feel the song,positive
Bring back the heart now I cant see my favorites in a plays list anymore oh and apparently I can only add a song one times now like seriously I have really long playlists and I wanna be able to add my favorites many times,positive
Please fix the app! The track that is playing won't show at the bottom of the screen like usual. If it's playing music I can't skip the song because of this. Most of the time now I open it and nothing will even load.,negative
Fairly decent music app. Lots of features and music choices. Little glitchy at times and some if the hidden permissions it requires for its self are a bit shady feeling but overall... not a terrible option out of the other currently available choices on play store.,positive
"Hi, I changed my account to 2 accounts, the monthly fee went up but the changes didn't happen, when you don't do your job properly, how do you expect to receive the fee?",negative
There are plenty of apps that play music. Find one that doesn't actively participate in the dissemination of COVID misinformation,negative
"Constantly glitching, have to delete the app with all my downloads to fix constant glitchess. 10 out a 10 would not pay for premium. Free apps in 2001 worked better. The JRE is the only reason I keep this terrible app. Also Amazon's music is slightly worse so you have that.",negative
Very easy to use! Good quality sound! I really Love this app!,positive
"Bad app, theres better options available, hard to navigate menus you have to pay money if you want to skip songs in playlists theres no option to just listen to a song you have to listen to through a entire playlist its just bad not worth the download.",negative
"Autoplay is frustrating. I hate when I connect to any of my Bluetooth devices, Spotify immediately starts playing. I'll pick what I want to play on my device, thank you.",negative
"The new app design is awful, buttons are way bigger than they need to be and quickly fill up the screen. They also added new restraints for non-premium users: you can only skip a few songs an hour and are forced to shuffle play through playlists instead of picking the song you actually want. Please bring back the spotify we all know and love",negative
"Well..... 2 or 3 years ago i thought it sucked.. until they started creating playlists for you that are ACTUALLY extremely accurate on your music taste , if you don't find what you want to hear on Spotify you'll end up having a new favorite Genre. Audio quality settings are outstanding and give you a great musical experience.",positive
"Since a few days I can't control my music every other song and I have to restart te app to get back the queue control. Please fix this, I've even reset my entire phone trying to fix this but the problem is with Spotify itself.",negative
"Abysmal app experience following the latest update. Tried to speak to staff who aren't really interested in helping, so a 1* review it is until its fixed.",negative
"Great music and streaming app. They make you great Playlist and find you new music that, the chances are you will like. The improvements I can think of for this service is to cast the podcast you're listening onto another device, and to have the music video playing in the background for different songs.",positive
It's mind-boggling how they put together their Playlist as if they just know what you wanna hear,positive
Super song all lyrics and all songs but adds that is not good okke. But best app in awere in songs,positive
Use it on all long drives because there are really interesting things to listen to,positive
You know why,positive
Superb you ask and you get it very useful whilst morning walk.,positive
"I have anðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š Excellent Idea for developers of this app, that can make create more Users in Spotify and Crazy Fans. ðŸ¤ªTry to add plus symbols that we can put our favorite songs on other Playlist...that thing is missing.

"1 star. Every time my phone gets an update and reboots. I have to download all the music again. This is very inconvenient when there is no Wi-Fi and or data signal around. Fix this, then maybe I'll update to 2 star. POS developer's.",negative
The Most advanced music app,positive
"Invasive and relentlessly buggy. I have Spotify Connect turned off, allegedly, yet I'm constantly bombarded with notifications to manage other public devices. Irritating. Also, Spotify is currently randomly quitting after 10 minutes of playing. High quality stuff.",negative
"Constant bugs (no play bar, ect.) Literally every time I swap apps. Also like button is too easy to accidentally unlike something",negative
Its a great app but it always keeps it on shuffle play,positive

most recent versions are broken. the player bar at the bottom of the screen does not appear. i constantly have to restart the app.,negative
"Playbar on my android has been disappearing or not working for days now. You'd think Spotify would rush through a fix for a major problem like this, before people started bailing.",negative
The music is great but why shuffle the playlist!? Its annoying when you just want to listen to that song even liked songs it is still shuffled remove this feature please ðŸ¥º its just annoying so much.....,negative
I love listening to music alot more than you think I do,positive
Super,positive
I love Spotify and would never use a different music streaming service but they have randomly changed my plan multiple times from a student account to a premium duo account for a few months and I have been charged extra before I notice and change it back.,negative
"I have had Spotify for 10 years and love the app, but what drives me nuts is that every once in a while they add a feature that auto-adjusts your volume for you and I HATE it; it's so annoying to set it up and then your music gets quieter when you didn't set it that way. The most recent add is the worst though, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TURN IT OFF. Spotify, fix this. I have always hated this feature and I need to be able to turn it off.",negative
App is crashing continuosly on Oneplus 8 after selecting new song,negative
Great app great access to music but I wish you could listen to songs without wifi without getting premium.,negative
Good,positive
"Does not work for me anymore, cannot play any music. Not sure what is wrong. I uninstalled it and then reinstalled and still the app will not play any music. Does not feel good to pay for something that doesn't work.",negative

WE DONT WANT TWO OF THOSE SO PLEASE FIX IT RIGHT NOW!!!!,negative
The latest update messed up my app. The bar at the bottom of the screen that usually displays a playing song disappears. I cant stop a playing song without force quitting. The app is barely functional on my android.,negative
Terrible!! You cant change the songs! You can only skip songs only 6 times per hourðŸ˜‚ and songs you liked will be played the same way plus it shuffles between them and not by order,negative
They give you every music u like so i rate it a ten it's amazing,positive
It is a great app to listen to music just wish there was a button to make it not suffle the songs ;),positive
"Spotify is a great app for music and also podcasts, there are so many educational podcasts, especially Joe Rogan. He is not spreading misinformation he is simply having conversations. Because he asked a question and his guest answers doesn't mean it's misinformation. If people have a problem with Joe Rogan that's ridiculous they should go after his guests that are spreading information/misinformation? Don't get rid of Joe Rogan!!!",positive
Since the update the app frequently pauses what I'm listening to every 5-20 mins. Also in the app the playing bar at the bottom is gone and I'm unable to choose to pause what I'm listening to unless app just does it randomly as i said above.,negative
I like Spotify better than any of the others.,positive

Music is great and so many songs to choose,positive
"This is great but the only problem is only on phone it gives all premium features but if I use my xbox, tablet or PC for spotify you basically have premium but with ads so why not just get rid of all premium features and let people with only a phone not have to pay for freedom also these ads are annoying at sometimes but a quick hack for these ads (Don't work on phone) delete the spotify tab or Close outta it and get back in :)",negative

App stopped working on Pixel 6 with latest update. Force closes instantly.,negative
"Stop asking if I want premium via email. It already sucks you talk about it in every other way so just stop lol. Also you guys suck at shuffling. Edit: the app is so glitchy for me and my friend, so this is definitely an app problem and not a personal problem ðŸ˜’",negative
"This is a great app for creating and sharing playlists, discovering new music/artists/podcasts, and releasing your own work. It is definitely worth buying premium.",positive
Most of the time you loses control to do anything in the app the controls what songs you want to play next. Also connectivity to the audio output( Bluetooth and aux) sometime it will just stop playing song with no explanation. This is the worse I've ever experienced with spotify.,negative
"Am paying for premium but getting advertising still in podcasts, what's up with that??",negative
Perfect! I love music and I found it in Spotify... â¤ï¸,positive
This app is great for anyone who likes music and not having to listen to ads every 30 secs *cough* (pandora).,positive
"I used to love the app but now that I installed it again I don't like it anymore, I can't even listen to the music/songs that I wanna listen to.

You took away the ability to watch video podcasts on my TV. This is literally the reason I have a paid subscription.,negative
I really like the app just that the ads can be really disruptive. But you can make playlists for you and your friends so I say its a pretty nice app.,positive
Loving being introduced to music I might not have heard otherwise.,positive
"Ok. I often have to delete than reinstall because I lose the ability to stop or change songs. Frankly, I would have stayed with apple had it been compatible at home.",negative

Exceptional App with 1 missing feature.. you can't search songs within your Playlist which makes it hard to find your favorite songs without going through them all. Please fix this,negative
Skip nahi hota hai limit me sab hota hai Jo ki pahle nahi tha,positive
"I've used Spotify for years, and recently got premium, and premium is definitely better, but free is still great. It doesn't use as much data as Pandora or other streaming apps, and has so much music that you sometimes can't even find on YouTube.",positive
The very thing to help me disconnect from real world and focus on my work by listening to music. I guess it really help me go through the day every single day working in the office.,positive
Nothing wrong with the content but it stops playing when the screen is off. samsung galaxy tab.,negative
App never shows my most recently played music properly. It doesn't link with my Facebook right either and support says there's nothing they can do. And the app is just glitchy. Spotify doesn't pay artists enough money.,negative
"The wanted music you want to play , you would'nt hear.. The music you would'nt need to hear is playing. So Awful..embarass..disgusting.. Please"" check this out. Phillippines Spotify ,did not serve will. Only there choices to be followed.. Embarassing 4 consecutive ads. Playing you can't",negative

Best app for listening to music,positive
Its the best app ever but toooo many ads,negative
Continuous playlist. Diversity and full entertainment,positive
"Spotify fixâ¹ your bugs and glitches! I love this app, but lately I've to uninstall and reinstall the app multiple times. But the songs still shuffle randomly, the song will play for about 18s then stop playing sound while the song is still going on. I go to skip a song and it will go forward and couple songs then go back songs. I cant play what I want.",negative
Very addective and super play list,positive
Love it. But you getting carried away with the Ads,negative
"Best music app ever invented. In addition to the largest music library out there, what I really like is how good the recommendations are. Finding new music is as easy as just tapping the enhance playlist button. Please add podcasts for Pakistanis. We're really missing out on that.",positive
"The app is great for listening to music and with the premium, its nice for long, offline rides, however, the app constantly forgets that you have songs downloaded and refuses to play them without internet connection, so if you're on an hour long vehicle ride, it gets really frustrating when you forget to check if little baby Spotify remembered to do its job and remember your songs.",negative
"Last update sucks. It was working amagingly, but when i updated it started to show application error.ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ i really loved this one.ðŸ˜“",positive
Has adds in the middle of songs but other than that it's ok,positive
This app was awesome until there's 2 adds you cant even skip they add songs to you play list not to mention they randomly turn on shuffle i used to use this app all the time on my old account now pandora is better or use 10 hour vids on youtube terrible job spotify its hard to think of anything good with this app that other apps dont do better spotify is the bottom of the list for music spotify i dont want to even see your adds anymore how far this app had fallen,negative
"I loved this app. Tons of options for music/podcasts. I loved it so much I got the premium and it was totally worth it until a few months ago and it started glitching. Every time I clicked a song/podcast it would play but wouldn't go to it. No option to stop/skip/read descriptions. Even clicking ""Go to episode"" wouldnt work. Then within 2-3 days or so it would update and fix. Then like 2 weeks later the same thing happened then fixed.Then again and again. I wish they would fix the issue for good",positive
"Best app, not just in music, but overall too. The interface is so user friendly and aesthetic. Keep listening to Spotify. ForcaBarca",positive
Countless music selection and very good sound quality,positive
Its amazing i love spotify,positive
Easy to find artiste and songs. Very good suggestions,positive
we keep having problems with Blackpink Lisa's spotify and you did not give any action about utm,negative
"I used to love this app but these ads have gotten out of hand. If I have to listen to this many ads, I'll just close it and go to pandora...",negative
"Useless! Never used to be this bad! Stops playing in the middle of podcasts and I have to unlock phone, go into the app to get it to start playing again and won't play unless the app is left open. How is this with Â£10 a month. Will be cancelling subscription!",negative
"Fabulous!!!!! There is so much incredible content, from songs to podcasts! I love it!!!!!",positive
Best music quality among music apps. Stunning experience.,positive
"I love the app. The only reason it is not 5 stars is when I start a group session not one phone plays at the same time. They are all off by a second. Not cool at all Spotify, not cool. Lol still an awesome app!!!",negative
"I love spotify, but ads way too much, atleast when transitioning to a new song evry 3 songs or so. It never plays ads in the middle of the song. Anyway, I hope you like spotify! XOXO",negative
"It has been an upgrade from our last service provider, pan something ?",negative
This app is broken. I pay for premium and im constantly having to unistall and reinstall because if crashing or glitching,negative
Ok so im fine with one or two ads befor i start my music but now im getting 4 to 6 ads in a row and im not trying to wait 3 minutes to listen to a song. I think its getting worse over time,positive
"easy to use, update many songs",negative
"I actually like this app, no complain but i really want spotify to do some changes regarding its lyrics feature. I really like song like punjabi, k-pop, and other languages song i wish i could convert these lyrics in english and could understand the lyrics in better...all i could do is search in Google for it's lyrics which is quite troublesome...",negative
Have subscribed for years and use daily.,positive
"Absolute shite controls always lock adds constantly run. Constant interruptions i never use it Plus you ruined the joe rogan podcast for me. Lies about watching video to allow for 30 minutes uninterrupted listening watch this add, then plays more adds after is play fist add. More adds then music selection Plus they ruined JRE",negative
Just Spotify on.. World off.. â¤ï¸,positive
I absolutely love Spotify,positive
It's very difficult to listen a specific song... I have to find in a album and then play... download a song and listen is more then easy and fast then Spotify,negative
Had it a few week so far like the music selection and doesn't repeat music when open next day.,positive
Was great at first but now you can only listen to 1 to 2 songs and then 3+ ads play. And their 30 minutes of ad free listening isn't 30 minutes.,negative
very good nothing really wrong with it but there are ads and can buy a premium to stop thy ads,negative
Having such an incredible experience music recommendations are spot on for me at least interface is easy to use the sharing option the ability to have playlists on screen locking playlists The clip that plays in some songs is a plus Great ,positive
Very interactive up with a variety of music,positive
When I play media it almost never has the pop-up player. I have to force close the app to get it to correct.,negative
"Used to be my go-to app for music & podcasts. Then recently it stopped functioning properly. App loads but ALL playlists/podcast/etc are empty. I've done all the available troubleshooting to no avail. While it works on my PC, I never use it there. So I'll be canceling b/c no one wants to pay money for something they can't even use. So disappointed.",negative
"Can't see the play bar,can't skip songs and have to close the app the turn off my music. Not a great user experience at the moment",negative
"It's a cool app. But it won't let me bring up the list of downloaded podcasts when I don't have reception. I enjoy long drives and I go off the grid a lot. 90% of the time, I can't access my downloaded podcasts when I'm off the grid. And it's really disappointing.",negative
Totally confused about switching phones so it sucks,negative
Excellent service and great song choices,positive
I have been using Spotify for over 2 years now am totally hooked. Totally recommend that you get the premiume I went on a trip and was the only one who could play music cause they all were downloaded.......I love the sleep timer feature as well,positive
Even when I have premium I don't get premium features,negative
"But after update this app show 2 advertisment, please don't become like a YouTube app , if I listen song then it play one song in repeat in some intervals of song. But other things are good i am happy from this app ðŸ˜ƒ",positive
Always showing no internet connection though it is connected.,negative
"Bad at sticking to a soundtrack, keeps splicing other music in or just going off on tangents. Interface is to simplified, can't tell if I've got a setting wrong, but it should be the most straightforward thing to play the songs contained within a single soundtrack so there shouldn't be room for user error here.",negative
"really not much to say im just here giving the app what it deserves, its simple to use and its super good quality like the song sound great and it even gives lyrics and stuff ofline its quite crazy so yea, i have been using spotify for a long time and will always the only thing is i wish there was a singles plan for one person thats like 9 bucks maybe 12 or 15 but im paying 25$ roughly just for me to use it but other then that profitable app great app",negative
"Good app with a great algorithm, when it actually works.... I get constant 'No internet connection' messages, whether on WiFi or 4/5g and all other apps work...",positive
"The app requires premium to be free of ads, and it also requires premium to play a song you choose without it being in a playlist.",negative
It is a great app,positive
Best music app out there as a personal opinion but would love it (and change to 5 stars) if playlist enhancement could also be added to the PC version of Spotify. No faults or bugs after a year of using and still going perfectly,positive
Wonderful app I may listen ahy song I wabt,positive
Songs were just stoped while using,negative
Solid two thumbs up... keep it up people,positive
A dreamy app to experience your life with more beats & melodies whenever you want... Just adds are intruption and remindes me how poor I am.... ðŸ˜…,negative
Even though data is on.. It shows offline no connection to data,negative
"since the last update, when a song is played, the play bar at the bottom disappears",negative
"Great app but the suggested songs when I hit enhance needs a lot of work. For instance if I remove a suggested song, putting it back after every ither song I remove is pretty aggravating.",negative
"I love this app it has all of my favorite songs and artists but there is one con about this app.the adds,but that is because, I do not have the premium so if you would like to buy the premium so you dont get adds then go right ahead.",positive
Wonderful,positive
Suggest for Japanese songs to have romanized lyrics,negative
"This is for Jill Wells Art mostly. I've enjoyedspotifymostly(beenGreatly annoyedattimesAlso) for years once I figured out how to makemy ownPlaylists.I was no longer at the mercy of shuffle play unlessIwabted2b and could also key queuefrom playlists made. Have you consider making then dnlg list,then go offline to listen. Sometimes its the best way. My only gripe isIwish there was a automatic filter that wouldnt allow me to DLsONGS I've already DL!! That would make my life 4000+ songs ALOT better",negative
"Great for streaming songs, would definitely recommend using Spotify! It has every song you could think of and the audio quality is amazing. Better yet, it even has podcasts which you can stream whenever. The Bluetooth connections work higher than my expectations and you don't even need to pay to play the songs you love. Spotify premium is definitely worth it, you can stream songs wherever you like, even offline. For these reasons, I give Spotify a rating of 5/5.",positive
"I have more respect for your company as you have not caved to the cancel culture mob. Definitely going to have to get a spotify subscription for sure now!! Thank you for doing the right thing, you have given some of us hope!",positive
Great love it but the paid version is way better,positive
"Good, all songs are available.",positive

Fantastic App. So far I found every track and album which I searched. Can't imagine why I did not start using Spotify earlier. Thouroughly enjoying the vast selection of music...,positive
Too many ads,negative

"Hi, Complaint to register. Whenever I play songs with WiFi the lyrics doesn't show up. That's all. Please help me out. Otherwise everything is good. Thanks",positive
"HORRIBLE! I decided to try 3 months free premium. Ha! Now every time I open it, all I get is a black screen. THANKS, SPOTIFY! Way to waste my free trial. I'll stick with Amazon music.",negative
"bring back the ability to play and shuffle at the same time or i'm canceling my premium. this is ridiculous, who asked for that to go away?",negative
"""Daily"" playlists are more like weekly. They also will carry some of the same songs on multiple playlists. The ""radio"" is useless and also loves to repeat the same 50 songs. Oh want to try a different artist radio? Too bad same songs in different order. You like 26 songs from an artist? Well here's the same one daily for a couple weeks. Forget the other 25. Garbage. At this point I might give YouTube Music a go.",negative
It's been awhile since I've had a great time listening to music,positive
"Quite cool and interesting,so far good I can recommend other funs to install it",positive
"Not satisfied for offline experience. I can't play my downloaded songs, they always hang on my phone.",negative
It's a good app .it's assessable and easy to use do it's really amazing(â—â€¢á´—â€¢â—)â¤ ..I love you Spotify your playlists are fantastic .I recommend you Spotify.,positive
I love Spotify it's great music all the time anywhere i go i got my music very easy to use just add the songs you love and start listening,positive
The app is nice Except for a few bugs lately the rest is correct My music keeps flowing ,positive
Worst app i have ever used. When you try to login it shows that it has an issue try later and not even twice or thrice but always. Please Spotify either look after this or you will have trouble later.,negative
Love it Use it everyday,positive
Best music app that is free and it has everything I listen too. I can also make as many playlists that I want!,positive
My choice of app for music and commentary,negative
It has annoying suggestions besides a few good ones but the stupidest thing I realized was that I can't download just one song only lists..,negative
"Love Spotify but I wish it could have the download feature and for me to listen to my podcasts offline. Overall, 4 stars",negative
If you are a music lover then this app is best for youâ¤â¤,positive
Best,positive
"Fantastic when wanting to know about the latest music and singers. As wel as old singers and songs, when u were younger.",positive
"Continuously getting worse. Each update to the gui makes it harder and harder to find or organize any of my songs. Crashes and bugs are frequent, sometimes forcing a reinstall just for the app to properly function. Has been this way for years and will probably remain this way due to the developers clearly disregarding the user experience with the idea that they have the monopoly on music streaming apps. Honestly, the only thing this had over Piracy was convinence, and it lost that years ago.",negative
I bet it would be better if you can add GIF photo to your playlist,negative
"30 mins 1-2 ads (pc), 10 mins 3 ads (android/ios)",negative
"I am trying to login to my account with my phone number but it is taking ages to get the ""vacation code or something"" and am unable to login [and the ads are annoying]",negative
Will not play anything. I would give it 0 stars if i could as it doesn't even do what it is literally designed to do. What is going on?,negative
"""This app is absolute garbage for listening to podcasts"" was my last review. But I was wrong. I was being hot-headed and not understanding correctly. I do apologize to the owners of this app. It works really well.",negative
"My overall experience in this app has been alright. There are some bugs in the new update like missing controls and all, but that's not the big issue. The problem is, I'm unable to see the lyrics of any song in my phone (realme 8 updated to Android 12). But I can see it in my PC. Please give me a solution to fix this issue asap.",negative
Good as long as you buy Spotify premium without it you don't even get 30 minutes of ad-free music only about four songs even if it's less than 30 minutes,positive
I had a pro account that was cancelled and it still charged me for next payment what is going on here spotify robbing ppl of their money also my suggested playlists never contain a single song that i search to play multiple times and even faved,negative
Not working. Will give more stars when fixed,negative
Crystal clear quality of sound and quick update of new release,positive
Love the access to favourites from the past Gym selections keeping me moving as well,positive
"Adds random songs from a random playlist onto the current queue I'm listening to. Also, why did you get rid of the song preview? That was really useful!",negative
get like Pandora nd let them watch one video and they get to pick any song instead of payin for premium just to listen to what we want.,negative
Will pause songs randomly of you don't give the app permission to run 24/7 in thr background without restrictions on android. I do t want it starting or running in the background when I am not using it. It acts like I lost signal when using it if I have it as a sleeping app when not in using it. I canceled my premium membership because of this issue. Why pay for music that skips because you don't want it running all the time when not in use.,negative
"Seriously.. What have you done to this app. Nothing works anymore. I have to delete the app storage beforehand everytime I want to listen to music. And as soon as I minimize the app e.g. to answer a call or a text, I have to close it and clear the storage again.. And log in again. Spotify became useless to me... And since this is going on for 3 weeks now and still has not been fixed, I will unsubscribe from the premium plan. Done with it!",negative
Great...many thanks that I can listen here to the best classical music!,positive
Most easily the best music app there's ever been.,positive
It has a lot of glitches and sometimes it just flat out doesn't work sometimes and the glitch that happens to me is it doesn't show the music bar for paused music. Other than that it's easy to use and I just hope it gets fixed,negative
"I can't even listen to one song without it pausing and skipping, it's been constant for over a month now",negative
"Love this app. Whatever mood I am in, Spotify can satisfy my music craving. I just wish I knew how to stop my notifications from interrupting my songs.",negative
ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜It is very good app with lyrics music ðŸŽ¶,positive
Good clear music no adds love it,positive
"Great app, amazing variety of songs and podcasts, only bad thing is a few to many adds even with premium",positive
Love listening to Charlie Musselwhite and other harmonica players.,positive
"I have constant issues with Spotify and connections. It take multiple tries to open the app, I've tried updating it, uninstalling and reinstalling it multiple times and still the issues continue. It happens when I'm on high-speed wifi connection, its really frustrating. I pay for a premium account and I've been asking myself, what am I really paying for.",negative
why can't I play the song I want and I can't skip and rewind please fix I'm disappointed,negative
"Horible it use to be good, i cant even choose the song i want to listen to and they added stuff to MY playlist?? Theres a reason i didnt have those in there. not helpfull just go back to the way you were like i could skip for FREE but now i have to buy it!? I just cant",negative
Play bar dissappears. When I am playing music there has been a bunch of times now where the play bar has disappeared. I have to close the app to get it to come back. I have so had the app crash. This needs to be fixed please. Thanks,negative
Artists will just stop playing. I will move to a different service once I have some time.,negative
It's a great app honestly but it's just playing a piece of song and that's not what I want but please get rid of this feature because it's pisses me off,negative
Lot of advertising,negative
"I like it, old music that people almost forget I can play now.",positive
"I have been using the app for 2 years but this new update has erased all my data after i reset my phone. At first i wasent even able to login properly, and now all my data is erased. Like, yesterday i added a song in my english playlist and in my liked songs, and today it is gone from the liked playlist and only my english playlist is left. I can't even see my hindi or punjabi and other playlist. It was like i just made an account and made an english playlist with 100 songs before hand. Fix plz",negative
"If only it had more variations of old artists old albums more like 70s/,80s even underground bands examples Pantera first 4 albums Metal Magic, Projects of the jungle, I am The Night , and power metal. You guys have Shotgun Messiah second album but not Shotgun messiah first album? Easy Action Swedish band with Zinny J Zan on vocals there's more I can go one and one and sure others feel the same way besides that use this app all the time lmfao ðŸ¤£ ðŸ˜‚ Give us more music ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽµ ðŸ˜Œ",negative
Prefect for playing through all your favorite songs,positive
User friendly and large selection of music for everyone at a fair price.,positive
Best music app I've seen. No stress to use and it comes with lyrics so you can be sure to sing along.,positive
"Other than a couple of small bugs that don't present very often, this app is great. Use it all day everyday. The obit thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars is its absurdly high battery drain. It kills my battery 3-5x faster than SoundCloud does, even when all other factors are the same.",negative
I love spotify cause it helps me find the perfect playlist of songs that I describe as what I feel all the time<3,positive
"Great apart from occasional overuse or bursts of annoying ads that honestly brain washing and subliminally is useless on me, cant retain memory cant afford anything other than what I need to survive. Im not alone, so what a waste of potential bliss . Otherwise love having spotify simply for its music nothing more.",negative
"Works great, easy playlist maker, all the tunes",positive
"This app is amazing!!!ðŸ˜ I love spotifiy so much, you can listen to music even when your not on spotifiy, like it will keep playing the song. This app is really good but I don't like the adds, the adds say ""listen to add free music for the nest 30 mins"" but right after that song there is another add. And the adds are very long, but overall the that this app is amazing.",positive
"A great app you can rely on. The only problem that annoys me is the ""no internet connection"" problem comes out despite I have stable internet connection.",negative
Spotify is the best the music is great!,positive
"Been a user of this app for 4 or 5 years, no problems until latest update, it's logged me out and will not allow me to log back in, can't find which email is linked with my account, no password reset emails received. Been crashing since the update, stop / starting songs, really irritating. I assume my music library has now been lost, hours of my time making playlists wasted. I will be cancelling the direct debit & moving over to amazon music.",negative
"Whether I have a subscription or Not, I prefer Spotify over the other music apps. I didn't give a 5 star for 2 reasons. 1 - When the app is completely closed and hasn't been used for hours/days. If my Bluetooth is on when I get in my car, the app will start playing. 2 - when I'm listening to a certain genre/artist, it plays songs from my liked list that are from completely different genre/artists. ( Keith Urban with Ozzy Osborne or CCR with BuckCherry....)",negative
Love my Playlist that Spotify recommends. I have my family hooked as well.,positive
Because it give many ads and dont repeat the song,positive
Always detected as offline,negative
"Was always working fine until I tired to access my Playlist, it won't let me play any of the songs on the play list and when I thought I got it to work it gave me a bunch of random songs and then kicked me out of the app when I got back in the app it won't let me do anything and even before this my experience with this has been horrible I wish I could give this a 0/5",negative
Decent app other than getting potentially 5 ads every few songs.,negative
"Spotify is a phenomenal app if you paid for premium. If you dont you will suffer countless annoying ads, 6 skips per hour on phone which sounds stupid and you cant select a specific song on your phone. You have to shufle through the album to listen to it. Why do i have to pay to get rid of this suffering?",negative
"I deleted spotify and downloaded it again approx. 2 weeks back and I haven't been log in to my account ever since then. 1) No there is no server or network issue at my end. 2) I was able to log in on the web version of spotify in opera browser in my laptop which means the issue is in the app. 3) I have tried changing my password, using OTP and even direct link that I got in my email but all were unsuccessful and everytime it throwed an error. Please look into it and reply.",negative
Just everything you could ever want from music app. Podcasts are great especially when the podcast is exclusive to Spotify and the quality is always top tier.,positive
Worst Music Listening Program It's too bad.,negative
"PLEASE BRING BACK BEING ABLE TO PLAY THE SONGS WHEN YOU ARE ADDING SONGS TO YOUR PLAYLIST THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY I FOUND NEW MUSIC i dont know why yall changed it, other than that I â¤ spotify",negative

Won't let me play music. I click on this one song and it plays me something way different.,positive
Awesome App for listening to songs...Has a vast collection of songs and is available for all platforms..which makes it very easy to use.. Android app has bugs though..!! Doesn't work on my Wi-Fi sometimes.. Hopefully the pesky bugs are removed ASAP...,negative
bruh why did you guys add an auto shuffle that you can't disable. not only that but why do y'all add songs to playlists for no reason.,negative
I've been paying more for less. Every time I open the app I'm spammed with an ad about some new content from someone I've never shown interest in. Now I'm getting ads for their car thing.,negative
"Overall, Spotify is a great app. But, as someone who has trouble falling asleep and likes to meditate, it would be great if the sleep timer could be set for more than an hour. - Suggesting a 2 and 3 hour option to be included.",negative
The app experience on Android is subpar. Lots of issues and broken interactions!,negative
After the latest update Spotify deleted all the music I had downloaded and continues to delete everything I download every time I close Spotify.,negative
Android update screws up the app. I contacted support team and they say they need to hack my phone and clean/wipe my phone over an cache issue. The issue is that their app doesn't seem to work with the latest android update and they do not understand that it is the update and not my phone. I do not agree to this.,negative
"Best music options, I like the mixes they crate new for me everyday.",positive
"Other than if you don't have premium and there is alot of ads, it works well, good to listen to in the car, at home or anywhere with the nice seamless connections, whatever mood I'm in, I know I can listen to something",positive
Love Spotify. Love the new enhanced liked songs playlist. Great variety of music.,positive
"I use Spotify daily but since the last update, I can't seem to scroll through the genres of my liked songs, please fix it",negative
Love this app but one thing I would add. Where you click button that would listen to the music and tell you what it is.,positive
Love Spotify best music app out there!!,positive
Best music based subscription. Basically useless is you don't pay subscription though.,negative
"TOP NOTCH!! By far the best app for music! you can download music so easily and ittle be ready to listen to in seconds! usually to download music you have to buy it, but spotify is where it's at!! Great job developers! EDIT: maybe add the swipe to queue for Android:)",positive
Get to listen to my music which is perfect,positive
The best music  app ever,positive
"The previous problem was solved, however now everytime I swap back to the app. It takes me to the top of the playlist, and when you have 400 songs in a playlist that's quite annoying",negative
"It's an amazing app to listen to songs and record it, there are many songs to listen to!but sometimes there are glitches.",negative
I'm so happy that Spotify told like 6 other apps that I like all this music I've never heard of. I'm so happy Spotify then tells all my devices play that music I've never heard of. Most of all I'm so happy I left Spotify 4 months ago so I don't have deal with it.,positive
I play a song that i want and it plays something else i disabled autoplay same thing i also cant even play 1 song no playlists or nothing im gojng back to youtube smh ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸.,negative
"Im a fan of spotify but the new update disappointed me. I can't even play the music I want, I need to wait a hour to shuffle it to listen to the musoc I want to hear. The new update sucks. It's harder to used. The last version is better. And the limited skips drives me crazy. I can't even skip the intro of the song because I can't control it. I hate the update. The ads are not tolerable.",negative
"This app has an abundant selection of music and podcasts to choose from. Easy to use, it is great for those that aren't technically inclined. I would highly recommend this app.",positive
This is the best free music app in existence. Don't believe critic reviews try it yourself you'll be impressed like I was. Thank you SpotifyðŸŽ§,positive
"I am a paid subscriber and have been using Android OS for >12 years; I know all the tricks. I cannot control the app or terminate a group session - none of the controls are working, even after stopping it from the OS app manager, clearing cache and data, and re-signing in. Unacceptable for a paid app.",negative
"You all have to fix your app I can't listen to half of the songs I want too, it's always glitching or messing up something is always wrong with it",negative
"Easy to use, has everything I want..it's just a great app. My favorite feature is being able to listen to my music offline.",positive
Ok,positive
"I've been using a 6GB RAM phone. But sometime Spotify takes a lot of time to load a song. I update the app as soon as I see update notification. I'm a premium user. I love Spotify, It's my only source of music. It's an amazing app. But if just Spotify resolve this issue, it would be 5 stars.",positive
It's available on so much media equipment that you can listen to your music everywhere.,positive
"I hate the shuffle feature, it's just a waste of your guy's effort",negative
The only thing that I would appreciate is if they would had a better software for when you tap the shuffle icon.,negative

"Worked great up until a month or so ago when songs or podcasts started randomly stopping. Also my pause/play buttons don't always show and I have to force quit the app to get it to respond properly. Makes the app nearly impossible to use, and I am a heavy user. I've deleted & re-download the app to and fix it, which did the trick for half a day. Will change my rating to 5/5 when this is fixed.",negative
"Update to reemphasize that each update makes the app worse. If I could rate it below one star I would. The latest update causes glitches so music will start/stop even when not using the app. Avoid this app, use Google podcasts or iTunes",negative
Best music app ever!!,positive
I love songs,positive
Too many ads so much irritated,negative
Too much ads. Using YouTube with ads has become a better experience now.,negative
It'd be nice to be able to stream a podcast without the constant random stopping when the screen cuts off. I don't mind the ad pop ups but how can you be a music/podcast app that can't even stream without bugs.,positive
Good music and good shuffle play. Sometimes it pauses the music when I receive a notification. Good if you buy the subscription. So glad I don't have to hear the ads anymore.,positive
Offline mode doesn't actually work. Don't bother downloading through Spotify. There's sites that let you rip your playlist and actually download it,negative
Very good app. Good visuals and good performance. I hardly face any bugs. Please keep on improving the app. Thank you. â€”Adithya K,positive
Nothing but positive experiences with this app.. the streaming music is literally endless...,negative
Paying for premium and I'm still getting ads,negative
Can only shuffle on phone,negative
Is an excellent app...but too many ads! I'm almost getting 3-4 ads after each song which is frustrating....I love the app but the ad situation must be fixed,negative
Very good for music on the go but hope they give the artist's the money they deserve from spotify,positive
"Trashy app just plays random songs until you buy premium even if you specifically choose a song it will give you a preview and then play some other random garbage, wouldn't recommend to anyone not willing to buy premium.",negative
Just got Spotify this past weekend and so far I have no complaint. Only wish that in your Playlist near the top there was a shuffle button. It would make playback easier than having to find the shuffle when you select a song. Not a deal breaker but still would make it easier,negative
I've had Spotify for the last 7 years and will never use another music streaming app for my phone. It's got a few kinks but it's nothing that would be too bad.,positive
What ever you guys did with the recent updates has changed the app for the worse. Feels like half the time I'm fighting for the app to work.,negative
"good app, but some how the play , stop, pause section has suddenly stop I cannot access it at all, tried all the rest still not working",negative
The Best music streaming,positive
"Ok. I'm a 73-year-old senior living on social security in California. The cost of living has got so high, I live in my car. Spotify, Disney+, Hulu, Netflix, etc are affordable, and on my car sounds system, they are fabulous. So I have an amazing social life, and in my own space I'm enjoying top quality entertainment. When I step out of my living space, I'm already at the location of my choice! And Spotify has all my favorite music right there for me.",positive
I just wish that there were less ads for someone looking for continuous music for stars.,negative
this was so good but you had to pay just to skip a song just one single sone and you also need to pay to rewind the music i dont care about the ads but just let people go back to the music they want to listen instead of ramdom names so you could just have a actually good music i would gibe this a 5 if this was fixed,negative
"I really love it, the original artists singers...cheers...xoxo",positive
Good everything good but the ads irritate me also at Android auto when driving the car it irritates me and also there are limited skips and and there is a limit of choosing songs thats why I am gonna give it 3 stars but after buying premium it is okay ,positive
"First and most, thank you for the opportunity to create this app. It has better my music library, And I have become addicted. Very good app, well arrange. But, create a periodic discount/ coupon / code. Most importantly, do not charge my bank account directly without pre notice, just because you have my details. However, thank you for the gift of music. Love you guys.",positive
"Music is good for the soul. Wise words from podcasts help fulfil the quality of life. But spotify, or any other streaming agency would not be anything without the artists. Over 180 million premium subscribers and the artist makes between $0.003 and $0.005 per stream on average! WOW! THEY DESERVE more. Period.",positive
"The app has been devolving with every update. This past update, Spotify removed the function where you could preview songs on a list of recommendations to add to your playlists. For what reason? No one knows. It's so frustrating that Spotify is intentionally making the app LESS user friendly.",negative
"Really ticked at you guys- first you're putting all these songs on my list that if I delete them, accounts against me and then my favorite playlist I've created disappears. I started working more recently and was going to upgrade but I'm probably going elsewhere for that now.",negative
Ty I enjoy music ðŸŽ¶ on Spotify.,positive
"Earned 1 star back. Now, allow Alex Jones to be on and you'll earn back the rest. I may even start buying 180 day subscriptions for my 23 employees again for their holiday entertainment.",negative
New update has taken away my premium access even though I pay for it. App quality has been in decline since 2019. Worst app on my phone.,negative
"So basically if I want this app to properly work, it's come down to me having to wipe all data from storage and reopen it like a freshly downloaded app every day because it's become so buggy, I've been using Spotify premium for years, it's crazy how they've constantly made it worse through non user friendly UI and bugs",negative
App is not working properly it keep crashing from last 2 weeks.,negative
Interupts my playlists with other music I have not requested. Really annoying!,negative
"After an update that altered the appearance of the player controls at the bottom of the screen, they now randomly disappear. The only way to stop the music is to stop the app running.",negative
Great way to listen to your music!,positive
I've loved this app for years- but there is currently a bug that is making is crash every three songs.,negative
"even in the newest version(8.7.38.667), I still can't view the lyric",negative
Work and go ads aren't to bad or long,positive
Fave a fun,positive
I like this app but sometimes it stops when I open any other applications so kindly fix it or give me a solution ðŸ˜³,negative
I am using a premium account and the app keeps crashing. Please rectify it.,negative
"Best music app out there. Can download to my own library. Save favs, even link with other apps like Google maps. A 5 star app all day!",positive
I only use this for podcasts. Unless you have premium thats all its good for,negative
Spotify is a really good app cause you do not have to pay for the songs and that's why I like Spotify,positive
"I disabled the automatic and timer player, but nothing works on this app ! Waking me up at 12 am !!!! With this music that I don't even like and I couldn't find a way to delete this music from play recently or from history!",negative
"Does not let you pick songs individually, does not yet you play albums or artists, does not let you see what songs are in albums. If you use the app in a car via Bluetooth it changes how ads work so instead of watching 3 and getting 30 mins without them, ads will play anyway after every song If you want to play an artist then Spotify will play songs that are as far away as possible from what you want to listen too. All these issues are only on mobile, tablets and computers work fine, greedy",negative
"This app continues to improve and premium is absolutely worth it. You can even play your own audio files. Problems get fixed, you can see your recents, UI is great, design is nice. Wrapped is always a highlight and you can mix yours with someone else. I love using it with maps too! Lyrics had been missing for years, im glad they're back! Problems rn: I might prefer if lyrics scrolled smoothly without the rapid change to the next line. I would also love to see which songs belong to which genres.",positive
"Easy, Free, beautiful (music for many parts of the world)",positive
Why does it happen that whenever I connect to my wifi connection it's shows no internet and as soon as I switch to mobile data it works properly please look into this issue ASAP,negative
please stop addding song that are not in my playlist. Its so annoying to listen to a song not on your playlist when you want to listen to YOUR playlist not what Spotify wants. I wish there was a option i tried everything and Nothing worked so PLEASE make it an option!,negative
ITS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE AND YOU CAN LISTEM TO ANY MUSIC FROM CHRISTIAN MUSIC TO ROCK FROM ROCK TO ANYTHING SO MUCH OPTIONS ITS AMAZING YOU CAN LOOK UP A BUNCH OF YOUR FAVORITE ARISTS AND SONGS ITS ASOME,positive
Great music and if you don't want don't mind the occasion occasional advert it's all free,positive
I've got the Premium Duo version and my friend can't connect even when I send the link. This problem happened the last time I got a premium plan as well. Please fix it. Edit : Its been months now and as you can see... There's no reply. The service is poor and the app is garbage. Don't even get me started on the downloaded songs option. Save yourself the trouble and the headache and use Amazon Music or Apple Music.,negative
I have listened to chaand baliyan on ads so many times that I don't need to play it on purpose. Thanks spotify otherwise a very good app.,positive
"Music is my life line, it gets me through the day, no matter what the day brings.",positive
Shuffle play is not a nice feature to the app please remove it,negative
"In my sister's phone, she has a option where she can see the lyrics, which I don't have. I've checked every possible settings but unable to find it.",negative
"Since the last update, my Spotify has been pausing frequently. It's very frustrating and makes my subscription a waste of money. Please fix it.",negative
"Everything is good, but for someone who is going to have premium some other day, it's just a hell. Stereotypical, repetive ads are so annoying. It's not about ads, it's about their annoyance.",negative
I cant open this years wrapped before the app crashing two seconds into the first slide. Please fix this,negative
I give it a 3 currently as the app is having issues with android atm. Keep needing to uninstall it due to the music not being able to be stopped as the music playing tab disappeared.,negative
Worst song app because it's have an add in between of songs so worst,negative
This app is real fantastic but more than songs there are Ads. Should I listen ads or songs sometimes I think that is this song app or ads what should I do. But this app is really fantastic I love it. I think this app should have a award of (MOST ADS ARE IN THIS APP MORE THAN SONGS). There are only some ads are playing but whenever I play songs they play ads is there is compulsory to get premium. please try to understand in few few minutes they play ads,positive
It's so cool. And fun at anytime like when I'm doing dishes I put on music and turn off my iPad it's awsome,positive
"App works, but when streaming from spotify connect and google cast devices, playback stops on ALL devices about every 2,5 song,... Doesn't matter if there is one, or more devices",negative
"I love this app! I have several playlists! All the negative ratings I've read, don't seem true! Spotify has not done any of those things to me. Highly recommend!!",negative
Too many commercials after first 30 minutes.,negative
I love it best experience so far for 2 years now,positive
"The app doesn't let you manage your Premium subscription, you literally have to use the browser version. 1/5 stars",negative
"Fantastic so far, one of my favourite apps!",positive
I'm usually pretty satisfied with this app but it seems like we are no longer able to preview songs when adding songs to a playlist. I hope they bring back this feature because it made discovering new music super convenient.,negative
"I think that Spotify is the complete program package. On spot, on time.",positive
"When it's great it's great, but it's glitching so badly in recent months. The control panel isn't there when I open the app, and when I play a podcast/ song then close and open my phone the control panel is gone, meaning I have to close out the app & reopen it a few times before the controls will appear again. So frustrating!! Also, I'm not sure if it is a phone update or spotify update issue but there is no +15sec/-15sec on my lockscreen anymore- just play/pause. So I have to unlock to skip!",negative
"I really enjoy this app, however from time to time I experience a bug where i click to play a song and it plays, but the mini player never shows up so I can't pause, skip the song or change where I'm at in the song. Restarting the app fixes it sometimes but it's pretty annoying. Other than that I've been using this app for years and I recommend it to anyone looking for a single place to keep their music",positive
Think it's better on iOS but I still enjoy Spotify on either OS,positive
Great music good definition,positive
Probably best music platform for all listeners out there in the world . Go for it,positive
Way more fun to add music and experience different artists when the algorithm matches genres!!! Apple could never lol,positive
Sound is good Like the personal playlist option,positive
It keeps giving me 2 or 3 ads you should do something about that and almost everyone is just broke in buying Spotify premium but everything else is fine,positive
nice,positive
Lyrics are not available in any song.,negative
Very well put together and easy to use. Keep up the good work.,positive
Great selection of music and the always play what I like,positive
"Awesome app when it works, and usually does when you have a solid Internet connection, but if you don't, it's horrible, even with music saved to my device, I can't cha get anything without an internet connection, and when I try, it stops, it's silent and doesn't play any music till I have a stable internet connection. My advice, start what you want to listen to playing before you leave your internet connection.",negative
Worked great until a software update. Now all the Playlist on my phone appear empty and Spotify claims it can't connect to the internet whenever I use search to fine music...,negative
Nice one Lyrics is shown nice ðŸ™‚ðŸ‘,positive
"Still can't believe I pay for this. By far the glitchiest app I've got on my phone. Constantly crashing or loading for 10 minutes. Once a week my entire library will just vanish and I'll need to redownload all of my songs and podcasts. I often lose cell service and the app is pretty much useless when in offline mode. Downloaded playlists take forever to load, if they even do. Quality constantly changes or the song or podcast will just stop playing on its own.",negative
"I pay premium it's worth it for the most part but every couple years I want to clear my liked songs, please please add a feature that allows mobile users to clear ALL liked songs in settings or something (but keep liked songs in playlist)ðŸ™",positive
Pixel 6. Android 12. Cannot slide the categories under my liked playlist. Fix before my next billing cycle or I will most likely cancel my Premium service. I'm not paying for crippled software and service.,negative
It's amazing unless you don't have premium so I would have to give it a four stop because whenever I get it on my Chromebook say I'm trying to get that on my Chromebook and I use it on my Chromebook it's scary ads just come up and it's scaring me and I use it at night so I'm going to have to give it a four even though it's an amazing app in all,positive
"I wish I started on Apple Music or YT music. Spotify shuffle plays the same songs all the time. I have about 1000 songs and it always plays the same 50 on shuffle. The push podcasts everywhere, your feed is mainly podcasts. The only reason I havent switched is because its hard to transfer so many songs to another platform.",negative
"Originally I rate Spotify with 5, but I wanted to calmly go to sleep soi search for mediation sleep and I choose a recommended list... And? It cut my went to sleep with a terrible advertisement to pay for premium. I will delete all meditation list.",negative
Sorry to say but it gives too much adds.. the more good is the music and the more is the no. Of adds . Btw I love it!! Just fix the no. Of adds...!!!,positive
It's really nice as you can make your own playlists but it doesn't show songs by its self. You need to search them and then add them all one by one.,negative
"My experience with Spotify has been pretty good over the past years, but since the removal of being able to preview songs when adding them to playlists the app hasn't been as enjoyable to use. I'm not sure why that feature was removed, as it seemed to be helpful to a lot of other people too.",negative
"Spotify is wonderful,I can listen to a large variety of music or jam only on my favorite melody. Spotify is my choice of happy listening.",positive
The only music streaming app worth using.,negative
It's crashing everytime I play something.,negative
Easy to use,positive
Picking a controversial character over a musician is a big mistake. Made my choice between this and YouTube music easy. Bye.,negative
So far so good. It's been amazing working with you all.,positive
Great,positive
Best music app after purchasing premium ðŸ™ðŸ»,positive

Spotify have became the worst app of music,negative
"It worked great for the last 2 months then all of a sudden I wasn't able to control the music from my lock screen anymore, only the notification bar or the app itself and I can't seem to get it to go back to ""normal"" after 3 reinstalls and a Google search.",negative
"Great app when using premium ðŸ‘Œ but with last update for Android I keep losing controls whenever music is playing... I can switch songs by clicking on them, but the bar with play/pause/prev/next is not visible... Have to reboot phone for spotify to function properly again... Devs can you please look into it?",negative
"I love how there are so many songs to play from Country to K-Pop, plus it has some amazing podcasts. I would rate it a 5 star, but the only thing is, is that you cant change how loud or how low the music or podcast is, ye you could just lower down your phone, but if you have other things, like if you were playing a game, you wouldn't be able to lower the music down so you can hear the game. But overall an amazing app.",positive
Player keeps disappearing. I have to manually stop the app every time i want stop playing music,negative
"Spotify was great until it stopped taking my credit card payments for premium Like JUST TAKE MY MONEY...PLEASEEE!!! Everytime I type in my credit card info it keeps saying ""payment can't be made. Country does not match payment option "". It matched for two months , what's the problem now?",negative
"I really love and enjoy the app, that why am rating it five stars, just that you can't download from there.",positive
It keeps stopping (crashing).......plzz tell me how to resolve this...i cannot live without music.......i have downloaded Spotify lite instead.....but i want tha old Spotify backðŸ˜’,negative
Good music,positive
Everything I need ..... The Ads are annoying tho,negative
"Ads all over the shop, you'll be targetted, sooner or later; impede your relaxing sad boi times with ""tHaNkS FoR lIsTeNiNg To sPoTiFy, YoU cOuLd HaVe LiStEnEd To ThE rAdIo..."" despite having listened to this short 30 sec ad to have 30 minutes of uninterrupted music only to be bombarded by the same ad four times in a row. What's worse, ads appear on premium for an ""authentic music streaming experience;"" if I pay for premium, I am expecting to have no ads, not as many as before.",negative
Besides not transferring over to my replacement phone I still rate five. Good Luck Spotify ðŸ‘,positive
"app keeps stopping in the background (not pausing) i tried reinstalling the app, changing the settings but nothing worked",negative
Love this app.its got great selection of music and artists,positive
It is soo booring app... Cause it doesn't respond some times when i search for some songs...... I rather install resso... It is so good when compare to spotify.,positive
It is alright its just when you try to play a specific song and it makes you shuffle because i could just go to soundcloud and the problem is fixed,negative
"Used to be great, now it's all messed up. Smh why can't a good thing be left alone. Might check out prime.",negative

"Honestly, there are songs that are definitely missing, but it's my Go-To for my music!!",negative
"Honestly impressed by how little storage space is used for each downloaded song. I've yet to find a song that isn't on here, so it's pretty much perfect for my needs.",positive
I really love this app I would just recommend less ads,negative
Excellent service that I always recommend to friends!!,positive
2 stars due to lagging play a song allgood 2nd song comes on plays for about 20sec then cuts off everytime. Iv uninstalled and reinstalled to see if it fix the problem and nothing still the same and I'm a premium customer this use to be one of the best apps.. what's going on Spotify paid customer to get ripped off not cool. If not fixed uninstalling for good take my $$ somewhere else.,positive
"Awful, like WHAT MUSIC APP DOESNT ALLOW YOUR OWN PLAYLIST, On top of that, STOP ADDING SONGS I ""MIGHT LIKE"" BC IF I LIKED THEM, I WOULDA LIKED THEEM!!!!!",negative
GOOOD IT,positive

Just love the options and music that I can find music so easily now. Too much Spotify.,positive
"I would like the paid version of this app to be available without commercials. Yes, the music is ad free, but the podcasts are not. Can you edit these out, please! 5 stars if you do.",negative
There is no option to change the lyrics languages,negative
I love when Spotify crashes or randomly decides to forget how load any data.,negative
Great music collections!,positive
Latest update removed the ability to quickly scroll through your liked songs,negative
Okay Spotify if its free thin you guys need to stick to that no b.s with limited skips really in my opinion Spotify needs to be pulled off the app store just because of how messed up Spotify is it plays songs I have no interest in and the add wall is so bad I only use it for my xbox,negative
It is amazing that you can listen to music and not get hacked on your account,positive
Good music featured wide by selection,positive
"Besides the ads, the music quality is great, their collection of Playlist is excellent, they have lyrics and their user interface is easy to use",positive
It is showing network connection error whenever I open the app or try to login Iam unable to play songs can you suggest me Something to solve this problem,negative
"The app has been incredibly glitchy the last few months - can't like songs, filter on liked songs doesn't work, songs won't play and app freezes all the time. I'm so close to giving up on Spotify altogether",negative
This is good app to learn songs but when the 60 days free premium us finished I got angry but also I give 5 star  to this super songs and some days free premium,positive
i was trying to see my top songs 2021 but the app keeps closing so i tried to delete the app and re-install it as this is what people said i should try but now all my playlists are gone after logging in and when i click on a searched playlist it does not open and the loading screen remains on and i don't know what i should do to fix this i have tried various ways but to no avail,negative

"After upgrading to MIUI 13 on my Xiaomi phone, the fonts on Spotify go crazy, a piece of this and a piece of that. Please fix this and let Spotify use system font or default Spotify font. Thank you.",negative
One star for the way you handled Rogan's story. Completely disappointed and frustrated by your decision to support disinformation and misinformation just because it's profitable. Probably the last days I pay for your services.,negative
Price on everything,positive
Ive had this app for over 6 years i think and to this day i still havent found any issues with this subscription service Updated I have found one issue now The shuffle doesnt shuffle all of my music Just the first 100 or so that I had recently added Rarely do I hear music is added years ago Other then that Still super solid,positive
"I really love this app but when I accidentally deleted and reinstall it, logging in was so hard. It always say that my password ang email is incorrect even its right.",negative
Pretty much got everything I look for. Don't know what else to really say. Love making playlists and enhancing them.,positive
"to he honest, I really hate the new update now! I cannot skip songs I cannot play the songs at the parts I like to- what's all this? Not everyone can't afford to get premium why do have to do like that?",positive
Last update ruined playback. Pocast keeps stopping for no reason.,negative
"Ads after every song? Not to mention the ads are priority as they don't take time to load off my CELL DATA, yet the song buffers here and there as loading it's data isn't priority over and data. Oh also nice false advertising, ""get 30 minutes and free after listening to these ads"" I measure the time, and it gets shorter each time, first time it was 27 minutes before an ad, then 22, eventually I measured it lower but can't remember. Good job Spotify, you're throwing yourself away.",negative
"Extremely buggy, the song toolbar which enables you to start and stop songs frequently disappears. And basic features like seeing and editing the playlists a song is contained in are missing. Also skipping a song removes that song from the queue which is frustrating",negative
I love the Spotify app especially when you go premium,positive
"Before I say anything else, spotify on PC is good. The app on the other hand completely sucks. Can't do anything without premium. You can't even play specific songs. App sucks, computer version is much better.",negative
Love Spotify best app to listen to music and call,positive
"Spotify has been consistent in the quality of the service they provide for the 6 years i have used their app. I have used their free account and payed for an ad free account. If you have the money then paying for ad free services and the option to download for offline listening is worth it for $10 a month. When I had to cancel paying accounts, i do not have a hard time switching to their free services and the process as straightforward and efficent.",positive
"Good app generally, but can't reorganize songs in a Playlist. Has good music, but not some of the YouTube music that we like...cocomelon and some English versions by spanish artists.",negative
"App had always been great until the last few weeks where music keeps randomly stopping and I can no longer see player controls, both on the app or lockscreen so can no longer skip songs/see what I'm listening to. Have tried reinstalling the app and can't find anywhere to file a report either.",negative

Nice app but it take a lot storage for long time. Can you please make it a less storage app ? It would help a lot.,negative
"Must have app, if you are member then play anything non-stop",negative
The music selection is fine but the app has been unfinished for years. Now it just auto plays without a control bar. The devs get sloppier and more careless as time goes on.,negative
Sexy,positive
The bar with the currently played music doesnt come up making me unable to start/stop the music.,positive
Love the quality and availability of my favourite by a push of a button,positive
I can turn my music on and it will play all night.,positive
Better than Amazon Prime which buffers on me about every other song. I don't even mind the ads.,positive
"Love the quailty of the music. But since Spotify doesn't want to let tom macdonald 's new song""the system"" play. I'm lowering my stars for Spotify from 5 to 3.",negative
I personally love Spotify because I can either play games and listen to music or I can consentrate on my work while my ipad is off! It's so easy to find basically every song ever! I say everyone that likes music must have this app!!! The ads are like 15 seconds long and they don't interrupt you in the middle of songs.,positive
Great app to listening any songs with high quality. App works properly and it can handle easily.,positive
"Spotify's recent decisions to support a deplorable woke culture, in favor of gutting free speech, I've deleted my spotify and moved on. Sickening stuff",negative
Ads are getting more and more annoying,negative
Can't play a song. It automatically shuts off. Probably because of the update.,negative
I really like the app but I have some lag issues but then again it's really good,positive
"After the update, Unable to play the songs of my choice. Only shuffle mode works which doesn't even play all the songs from the Playlist. Another issue is tht only 5 to 6 songs can be skipped per hour. ðŸ˜’",negative
I faced a problem at third time of not showing my liked songs list & other songs also not playing.,negative
"Spotify only has mainstream songs, so you can only listen to songs youve heard a million times on the radio and everwhere else. Also is not worth it unless you buy premium. Its an amazing app IF and only IF you have premium. Otherwise its conplete trash.",negative
Way too many adds,negative
For some reason my app just loses the playlist until I close the app. Then I turn the app back on because the playlist is back all of the sudden.,negative
My one fav app because I can listen all the time with my fav song but when the other update come I got irritated because I can't pick on my own......... How can I listen to my fav songs...?,negative
"Can't even choose a song. If you select a specific song, the app will choose some other song for you.",negative
"App breaks constantly, crashes, will be ""playing"" and no sound, or press play and nothing happens. Repeatedly having to close and restart the app to get some funtionality out of it. Hot trash",negative
"Spotify keeps showing unexpected notification: trying to play..., when it is not run. it should Not be automatically trying to Blast into tunes unsolicited! and at unexpected times every day.",negative
Its best music app.,positive

Been a subscriber for over 10 years and there is no other app like it.... Please don't change anything Kanye.,negative
"Theirs alot of ads tho, the shuffle is REALLY annoying, & I hate how we cant skip the music as much as we like.",negative

Very easy to use with a great variety from every genre of music,positive
I absolutely LOVE my spotify app! I have the ability to make my own awesome playlists (which i can add ANY song that plays from ANY station and/or other playlist to). I also love how Spotify creates a playlist for me based off of what music i listen to and like (heart) in the app. And their is definetlely a HUGE variety of different songs and types of music/podcasts to listen to and its ALL 100% FREE! The ONLY thing i really dislike about the app is that i am not able to just search specifc song,positive
VERY BAD. i have used spotify for so long and now its lagging alot! I search a song thst i like and after i press the play button alot of other songs come up!!!! I have to say my excperince on spotify is a 0 out of 10.,negative
No ads and great selection,positive
I have enjoyed my experience with Spotify but it is not without it's flaws. My phone app was acting stupid for a while and it caused alot of frustration with no support to help me fix my problem.,negative
UPDATE 2022: Subscribed for over 5 years still use it everyday. UI has gone from perfect to God like. Along with their amazing tailored playlists. Changed from Pandora and iTunes to this it does it all. I'm always suprised how much movie and game soundtracks it has along with how much obscure artists and podcasts it takes under it's wing. Always a recommended app,positive
"Been crashing a lot lately and a lot of artists have been removing their music from it. I've been with Spotify for a reaaaallly long time, but I'm starting to look elsewhere.",negative
If you buy premium then you don't wanna stop listening. Without premium there are too many advertisements. So i give it a 4star,positive
"I loved Spotify, until I started getting ads after every song. It's so inconvenient. I would rather use mp3 files. Atleast keep a 3:1 song ad ratio. Disappointing.",negative
I love the features and flexibility.,positive
The button for my skip or shuffle is gone. I have to uninstall and reinstall to see it again and then after a while it'll do it again so I'll have to uninstall and install again,negative
Great music selection..,positive
"A best place to listen music any time, anywhere. Now, its a part of my life.",positive
I love it after the recent update  it was unnowin but after some time I realise that this is good because I use to skip songs and play the songs that Im familiar but now I listen almost every songs from start to end  now I can say it is good for our attention span time,positive
Ok not bad,positive
This app has bought many good times for hanging out with the family or when I'm gaming it makes it so much better thank you spotify,positive
I really like using Spotify bc it's really easy to find songs o want to hear. I really recommend it,positive
It's a great listening app plays songs according to your likes and they give you a 30 min add free music intro. So you can enjoy as a first time listener.,positive
"It makes my day when I find the playlist to go with just one ""Single"" based on yearly day and time design. I wish they'd sponsor mixtapes...",positive
"Love it! So much better than Pandora or GoogleMusic. I've found so many cool new artists from smaller, lesser known labels as well as my favorite 80s and 90s artists. Much larger catalog, user friendly, love the playlist creation options. I pay for my subscription. Cxl Joe Rogan. It's not that hard to do the right thing.",positive
A realy great app for music it might be some what confusing the first time u use it but its easy to get the hang of,positive
"Such a horrible user experienceðŸ˜µâ€ðŸ’«ðŸ˜µâ€ðŸ’«. The app didn't even have the button to close the current music ðŸ˜‘.For last 3 days, M not getting the button to play any song when i tap on it, it just play the highlight of the songðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜µ, I cant see the queue as well Unistalling ðŸ¤ðŸ˜µâ€ðŸ’«",negative

I can't choose the songs I want to listen to anymore it just does something random now.,negative
It is a good app For free music. Though I would like them to improve their UI a bit more.,positive

"The latest update is a mess. Please fix the bugs. I can't pause my music or even skip, it stalls and pops on without a warning.",negative
Fantastic app and well worth the cost of going ad free!,positive
It's wonderful!- even without Spotify Premium...though the ads have been getting longer,positive
I enjoy all the music and play time never have a problem!,positive
Podcasts keep stopping whilst listening,negative
Just Great. Have had premium for years and love it more all the time.,positive
The problem is that I'm trying to listen to my music but on phone there is no way to stop the randomized song option which chooses from your Playlist which doesn't sad to bad until you notice that they also added songs so play instead of your music and I've spent an hour deleting music off my Play list that I didn't even add and after I finished they added more songs so basically what I'm saying is is that I can't even listen to the songs I like when using this app,negative
"I love Spotify soooo much. The only thing I think they can improve on is 1, you should be able to add songs to a playlist when listening on the TV. 2, I think they should include music videos to the songs. Overall I think Spotify is the best music app ever, and I hope to all of you considering to get it, do it. Yours truly, Elizabeth.",positive
Hello i love this app Been using for 3months but why is the Spotify showing up whenever I play Timber (by Pitbull) on my computer it shows up . Thanks :),positive

FAV,positive
Great music app very easy to use I like the way it is set up user friendly,positive
"I've been having an issue where I'll start playing something, but the ""playing now"" module doesn't appear. Which makes it impossible to bring up the ""playing now"" interface. The workaround is to close the app and open it again.",negative
"I usually love this app, but a problem has come up with the song queue. I can't open it at all, and this has only just started happing in the last few days. I upgraded to premium a couple weeks ago, not sure if that has anything to do with the issue? A lot of others Spotify users seem to have this problem too. I'm updating the app again, will see if that fixes it.",negative
"It's a nice music app but then when I play a song from a playlist, it plays a suggested song, which I find annoying. I just want to listen to the songs I added in the playlist, not the suggested songs.",negative
I cast music from my phone to my stereo I can hear every instrument that plays,positive

"You just deserve thatðŸ˜ I wish they added those ðŸŒŸ. Like 10 ðŸŒŸ, you just have to earn it. All what I wanted to listen in 1 place ðŸ˜ ðŸŽ¶",positive
I've had this app for a long time and I've never had any problems with it,positive
"this app constantly plays 'suggested' songs with no way to disable it diasabling autoplay doesn't do anything to rectify the issue and it is a hard situation to get out of since there's no way to really jump to any track of your choosing in the mobile version (u can do that on desktop), just plays previews and you only get 6 skips on the free version so don't even try skipping unless you have premium ads are constant too spotify please let me listen to anything i WANT to, not what YOU WANT.",negative
"Last week or so the app just stops playing. Even when open and playing it doesnt show me 'now playing', so i know it's gonna stop/close/mess up as soon as i minimise spotify. Always has annoying little 'quirks', but this is frustrating because i have to keep stipping what I'm doing to fix it and it gets me out of my mood/stops my flow.",negative
Sheesh,positive
I don't know if this is just a problem just for me but everytime I choose a album with just 1 song it plays other songs before I can even listen to the song I'm trying to listen to then it also wastes my skips so then I have to listen to other songs I didn't even want to listen Spotify I think you guys so fix this problem,negative
"I used to be able to quickly filter through my liked songs by scrolling through the alphabet on the right hand side of the screen. It seems with recent updates that this feature has been removed for some reason. As I have over 1000 liked songs, this leads to endless scrolling until I get to the song that I want. Please reprogram this filtering option.",negative
good,positive
"Please fix bugs for Samsung Galaxy, this is an actual joke - now playing button disappears, and Bluetooth connection continually cuts off. App is currently unusable.",negative

I go into the app, select a playlist and press play.Later if I want to go back to skip a song or something the controls are gone and the app indicates that no media is playing, whilst music is playing. I have found that this happens as soon as I go to another application that uses sound, when I receive a call during playback or simply when I paused it...",negative

"It is the best music app. We can even make our own playlist . it is truley amazing music app.. but it truly have many adds .. It would be good if they just remove adds. After every song there is an add. Just exhausting.. Plz, fix this",negative
I have Spotify since 2015 and I can honestly say its the best music app around. Spotify has been my most used app ever since.,positive
"Every update seems to make it less and less useable. If only there was a better alternative. (Found Dezzer, better in almost every way)",negative
Great music in my opinion,positive
Total changed from good to worstðŸ˜­ðŸ’” i even cant play my playlist youtube music is now even better,negative
"So there's this very annoying bug where after you go into offline mode, the app auto logs out and doesn't let me log back in. I've literally had to uninstall and reinstall the app to access my account. It's a great app and premium mode is really awesome but this bug makes it a real pain. If its fixed, I'd give the app 5 stars but till then, it stands at 4",negative
Resso is better than this...on comparison resso have more quality audio with much less advertisements..,positive
Idk what to say but if you are searching for a music streaming app this the best app you'll find in the entire internet.

Could do better at loading when in offline mode since it's all already downloaded,negative
Sometimes I have to re-download it every couple of months Other than that works fine,positive
"I love ittttt, there's no ads even though I'm using it for free",negative
I love this app because if youre favorite artist is not on youtube or any flatforms you are just going to search it on spotify and it will come out already without having a hard time,positive
"I love having MY music at my fingertips! I don't like when Spotify decides to add music to my playlists though. I know you can turn that feature off but it does it on its own sometimes. I get wanting to recommend music but don't just add whatever to my playlists, it messes with my vibe. ðŸ˜‰ Other than that this is a great app!! Thank you!",positive
Great format easy to you's and app plays wen your in other apps as well as on home screen and screen off ðŸ‘ŒâœŒï¸,positive

Whith the new April 13th update you can't play any songs without shuffling the songs so i wouldn't install it right now untill it's fixed,negative
Pretty good app. Would be nice to be able to pin more than 4 playlists/albums,positive
Literally horrible I don't understand why I'm trying to listen to music and ur sitting here playing ad after ad just after one song. And it would be the same ad get a grip,negative
Very good quality and selection of music with an easy to use app,positive
I literally can't pause. The only way to stop audio from playing is to close the app.,negative
Was good while it worked but stopped working on my phone hopefully future updates will fix,negative
Have been enjoying Spotify for a few years. Always finding new things,positive
"Problems with payments, can not add new card, catching lags (tried 3 diffrent), all the time problems. At 'premier radar', songs which i was listenning 5 years ago at another account, but they are 'new'. The funniest thing, after 10min starts crushing app to running and headphones connection. I was thinking thats fault of headphones or system.... Yeah, spotify.... Well done. That was 3rd time in 3 years when i tried use this service. No thank you",negative
"The app is great. I would give it five Stars, if there was a way to skip and then six times. Another then that it is a great app to Liston to music on. It was the only app that I found that worked at school.",positive
What happened? Since July 4th the app won't work on my phone. It keeps stopping or shutting off completely and it won't play in the background. I used this app for sleeping and can't. There is also no way to skip or relisten to anything. Please fix! We pay premium and don't want to find another app for music and podcasts.,negative
Best choice I ever made was to download Spotify,positive
I hate this app after every song i play im getting an add like wth whenever i add a song to my playlist it goes down to the bottom so i cant even listen to the songs i added recently.bout to delete this app,negative
A good music app when it works. I keep on running into issues where I click on songs in my liked music and they don't play. Also when I'm playing a playlist from my phone to the Xbox series x it randomly starts playing different music. This is ridiculous for a Â£10 a month subscription this needs to be fixed it's been happening for months. If these issues are not fixed soon I'm going to cancel my subscription and start using a different music subscription service.,negative
Very nicesong unspeckted and no any add and no any problem during the hearing the song this app is very smart likes other,positive
"Since launching the floating bar for the currently playing music/podcast, I am often left with no controls at the bottom or my notification drawer, and then I have to kill the app to get it back.",negative

"Excelent, I'm an artist and I find it's ease of use is great and cool for discovering new music and artists, works for me, highly rate it",positive
Love this app for 6 years butbits starting to become bug-gy. My Spotify continuously crashes meaning I have to set up music multiple times while working which is annoying but I've had the app for years and don't really want to switch. I also find podcasts are great but the app is not designed for podcast listening and hoards your previous plays meaning you need to manually undownload or get rid of podcasts you've listened to which sicks for podcasts but is awesome for music. Many pros to Spotify,negative
perfection,positive
Yeah it is great to listen music,positive
It is the best music app in playstor,positive
"The music selection is great and I have been using spotify for a long time now but the app keeps playing the same song or album over and over again even after closing the app entirely and restarting my device. On top of that when this issue happens, I cannot use the music controls to change the song and half the time picking a different song doesnt work. There is still no clear way to speak with tec support to fix this issue.... will update when I have been contacted or the issue has been fixed.",negative
I switched to Spotify for The Joe Rogan Experience and found a bunch more podcasts to enjoy...glad I switched...,positive
"There are so many relentless ads, too many considering how little they pay their artists. It will say that I have ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" and then play 4 more ads (no exaggeration.) It's tiring and annoying.",negative
"I love the app but recently it will briefly cut out in the middle of songs (downloaded ones too). It also randomly stops displaying what you're playing. If I decide to use the phone in the car (through the car) Spotify continues to play whilst I'm on the call. Has UAT being given up? Really irritating. I've resisted going to Amazon music, which I get for free, because I love Spotify but if this carries on I might have to. Spotify definitely needs to resolve this asap.",negative
A really good app to be sure but why does the interface change occasionally,positive
Everything works smooth and really enjoy it! They're always making improvements,positive
Very nice and easy to find and listen to music :),positive
"Scam. I got premium and the app does not even work at all. How do you even manage to mess up this bad, so many things in this app don't work, even the play/pause button... DO NOT BUY I have seen small children make better apps than this.",negative
It's gotten so bad recently The ads are so much Now the app also started to just stop Playing and needs to force shut down automatically.,negative
It is so good app but many ads are come in songs,positive
"Has just about every song, great site",positive
This app has a POS and it deletes my podcast or music three days after I listen to it just the best at being the worst it is now outdone by a string with a whistle on it at least that's consistent oh wait I believe that's also called YouTube anybody wants to use a decent streaming platform pick something different Spotify sucks the biggest of testicles honest opinion thank you I hope Spotify reads this screw your application.ps they are not number 1 in free streaming that's YouTube if anyone,negative
This is a great app cz you can download any song you like,positive
Music options are exceptional and Variety,positive
While In session when adding songs in queue there's a small pause in the currently playing song please fix ... It's like glitch or something ...,negative
Apprehensive at first but the fact that they didn't cave to censorship(totally) is why I love Spotify. Free speech always!,positive
"All round great app. Well worth paying the subscription for. Discover weekly is my favorite feature, I've discovered so many artists I now love. Also appreciate the ability to download songs for offline use, no other app has stood the test of time like Spotify has for me.",positive
The app has all the original version of the songs,negative
Spotify's good reputation is well deserved. Their recommendation system is first rate; the user experience is very strong and is regularly improved with updates.,positive
I really like the app and enjoyed cool music thanks for good job keep it up,positive
"I've found every song I have searched for, even the older songs. The sound quality is excellent. I tried Deezer before Spotify & there is no comparison.",positive
Good,positive
Great I love the podcasts available,positive
"I really love Spotify but at the same time I also love Pandora I have been using Pandora for a while they have 1HR of ad free music Spotify only had 30 minutes of ad-free music so maybe that's something that Spotify can match so speak also I do not like the fact that you cannot scroll back to see who you recently listen to just now I accidentally said I basically didn't like it because this artest cause I pressed some circle with a line through just keep it simple, its a give n take :/",negative
"Plays songs I don't want to hear Set a playlist plating, say something like best of Radiohead, plays one song from playlist then some God awful souless pop song completely unrelated. If this was a free app wouldn't be so bad but you pay for premium so you don't have to hear the songs that clog up the radio and this is what you get. Appalling!",negative
I can't leave this music player because Spotify is the best music player in the world my missed and lost songs I found my songs in Spotify. Love you Spotify...â¤ï¸,positive

Ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling, restarting my phone etc and it constantly does the same thing. This app sucks.",negative
Nice to listen to music while just walking,positive
It's honestly the best app for music,positive
Fantastic many songs have changed my life,positive
"Using the app has become tedious, it doesn't show what track is playing in or put of the app. Will constantly say trying to play Spotify while music is playing. Cannot control the music playing because there is no controls anywhere, which means once it disconnects from Bluetooth instead of turning off like usual it continues playing and you have to shut the app to turn it off. I find I am not reshing for Spotify any more due to this issue and now wasting my money.",negative
"Literally , Spotify is awesome ðŸ‘ŒðŸ» ðŸ‘ .Just love it ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜ â¤ï¸",positive

Very nice aap,positive
"Excellent. Except, I would prefer if I could see number of streams on every song.",positive
Music will stop at random intervals while getting rid of the stop play and pause buttons. I pay for premium for downloaded music but to listen to anything downloaded i have to put my phone into airplane mode or turn my wifi off.,negative

This is the best app for songs I ever had ðŸ‘,positive
"Easy to use with an almost infinite music library plus extras, the best music and listening app I've ever used",positive
Terrible if you commute on an underground subway. The UI and your library of downloaded and locally stored music cannot be played unless you manually switch the app into offline mode. The app should gracefully handle periodic outage of wifi/wireless connectivity and still function. Will likely be cancelling my subscription for this reason as Spotify is how I listen to music on my commute.,negative
Everything is better in app but there are two things which makes it only better not the best which is (i) It must have a functionality to delete the history songs which I have listened in past so that it would consumes low space and (ii) I can't find the most old songs during 90s era and this makes me awful about that. Pls try to solve this 2 major issues so that next time I will give 2 more stars by converting its BETTER to BEST.....,negative
Keeps auto playing when I get in my car . There is no fix . Gonna delete ..hopeless.,negative
The progress bar issue was fixed and it is the great app it used to be once again,positive
Can always find the best tunes on Spotify! We love it.,positive
Best music app I've ever had!,positive
Spotify is good but I like SoundCloud better. Because SoundCloud allows you to listen to music without any Wi-Fi Spotify you have to have Wi-Fi to listen to music. So that's why I have both they're both are good I like them both. But I think if Spotify made it a little better so that when you're on the go and you're jropping or whatever and there's no Wi-Fi you can listen to music I wish they could make it like that.,positive

it was excellent before you were able to hear 15 seconds of a song to see it you like it before you add it to your playlist but now you cant which sucks,positive
Keeps logging me out and am currently trying to log back in nothing is working and it keeps saying it sent me a link and it doesnt show up.

I wouldn't sweat losing a few has been artistsâ¹ who can't resist using their so called influence. So keep on moving forward.",positive
Spotify is a staple in my life. I don't know what I would do without my music. Great app..especially the song radio feature.,positive
Very user friendly and does exactly what I need it to do. Having the songs downloaded also helps when having no service or wifi connection.,positive
"App seemingly gets worse with each update. Bugs and unnecessary social features have plagued each iteration of this app for the past couple of years. What should be a simple music player with an online library has become bloated. The app is far from a seamless audio player, and overcomplicates most interactions I have with it.",negative
"Spotify offers digital copyright restricted recorded music and podcasts, including more than 82 million songs, from record labels and media companies.

Nice and user friendly,positive
Easy to use and you can find any tunes you want,positive
"I loved this app. Now i just like it. It never updates automatically, songs stop playing,will not play the next song quite often. I feel like im back in the 90s with manually changing the songs. Hopefully the bugs are fixed. I dont want to cancel my membership. This is why i left pandora. A year later...worse!

"Amazing app for songs, It's one of the best I've used of all for music...... there are just too many ads but everything is exceptional and premium was also good.",positive
"Ot was good until they started musically profiling me using radio wave brainwave frequency mindhacking devices. Now, all if the lyrics are different than the artist's and it's nerve wracking..",negative
The app will just stop playing music out of no where and if I start the music from the noti bar I can't controll the music anymore until I close the app and reopen it. This has been a problem for about a week now so I'm hoping you'll fix it as soon as possible,negative

The best music app in the Market right now.,positive
"Spotify gets worse with every update. Now, the app doesn't always display the song I'm currently playing on the bottom while in the app. Very frustrating, especially as a premium user. Will consider switching to another music player if it isn't fixed soon.",negative
ðŸ‘ðŸ¼ Thanks for not folding to the leftist or far-right pressure. That's a good thing.,positive
I tried to make a playlist of my favorite songs but then it plays songs I didn't put on there and I have never listened to so Spotify is the worst app you will ever have,negative
It will be better if u allow one time purchase of yearly subscription for student accounts...since my card isn't accepting recurring payments it's so irritating to manually subscribe every month,negative
"In first time, this app is disatified for me. I try to creat account but always reply to me something wrong. Free Log in,Log in with facebook, Log in with google account like that show me but can't sing in. What a uselsss app.",negative
Awesome to listen to my favorite music anytime!,positive
Customer service is appalling. I am getting charged for two accounts and have tried to enquire multiple times without success,negative
"When I press on the songs I want to listen it just shows a demo, everytime I click on shuffle playlist it will play songs that aren't even on the playlist. Used to love Spotify, now I just use it to keep track of the songs I like",negative
"why is it it so different on android than on apple or computerðŸ¥² on android phone you cant even decide if you wanna shuffle it or not, you cant put your playlist on loop if you have too little songs, you have to list the other song Spotify chooses. but all of that doesn't happen on apple devices or computersðŸ¤¦â€â™€ï¸ why is that :( thats why i only listen on my computer or ipad :/",negative
Buggy as hell lately. Player controls dissappear until restarted. Suffer for some features from the webapp-dont-remember-scrollposition syndrome. Eg. On the podcast list view. Also frequently forget where my current position in a podcast episode is.,negative
"It was an amazing app but recently i can't even open my app , the songs stops on their own ....please look at my problem",negative
"Turns off randomly. The playbar is gone, so no way to stop/start or rewind/FF.",negative

"I adore Spotify. I would give it a 5 stars, if it weren't for a couple of issues I have with it. For example, the free version is loaded with too many ads, to a point where you hear them more than the songs you are listening to, as well as you can't pick and choose a single song. But this app is amazing. I bought Premium, and I adore it. You can listen to the same playlist as your friends, combine music tastes- and I especially like making my own playlists that last up to 35 hours of music.",positive
Spotify makes my life considerably much better!,positive
"Listend Same advertisement 'chaand baaliya' more that 50 times , i think I'm gonna delete this app now , highly annoying (50 times within 3 hours app.)",negative

I like Spotify very good application,positive
Amazing App all you need for the soul and more .. music is life,positive
"Last update ruined this app, now it randomly crashes , the play bar disappears",negative
Constantly crashes the UI but keeps playing. Must be force closed.,negative
Very user-friendly app. Enjoy the relaxation music to help me sleep. Highly recommended.,positive
New update is terrible. Songs fail to play and when they do they fail to stop. Along with buttons not responding. App worked perfectly on previous version and looked better too :(,negative
Love Spotify. I'm a premium member. Since the last update the app hadn't been functioning properly. Please fix .,negative
"Ads are too many, too often, and too long. Very annoying and you can't fast forward thru the commercials.",negative
I'd rate it 4 stars but lately the app is acting strange. The song randomly stopped by its own and can't play the song it just freezes some people also has the same problem like this. Please try to fix it,negative
Very nice app. I like it. New ðŸ†• song ðŸ¤£ sunya and jio ton lagaya. Anything. But I really like app.,positive
my downloaded song are removed after my subscription had ended. very bad policy.,negative
Plays random music can't decide it on top of that the recommended music is always garbage rap or pop the people in charge clearly don't actively listen to music,negative
Love it has everything I want and the release radar helps me keep up with all the new and older bands I enjoy,positive
Great. If we are going to have so much ads why can't we have 320kbps?,negative
Incredibly buggy lately. Doesn't start the song anymore I have to kill the app each time I pick a new playlist as of last week,negative
Great music and podcast even in Spanish,positive
LOVE,positive
I can't turn off shuffle I don't have the icon,negative
What's the point to keep on sending me e-mails about lyrics and nothing is available? The user experience seems to keep getting worse... Might be time to transfer my subscription to another music app.,negative
"After so many years in operation, one would think that they would fix al least some of the bugs.",negative
"Listened to a song for a few seconds to see how it is. The playlist from which the song was, is now stuck on my home screen under 'Your Shows'. I cant even remove it. Irritates me everytime I open the app.",negative
Spotify was my favorite way to stream and listen to music but they continue to publish joe Rogan podcast which has actively led to people's deaths through misinformation and hate.,negative
Love to hear your music ðŸŽ¶ on Spotify,positive
"it's very good,speedy and does not consume much data/MBs",negative

The music quality is excellent.,positive
Great App ever keep it up guys like this ðŸ‘ ðŸ‘,positive

Best music app around,positive
I love the app but it has like a million glitches like Not showing the name of a song or randomly pausing the music and much more but it wouldent fit in 500 characters so i think i will stop here,negative
We spend most of our day listening to our favorite songs on Spotify. The recommendations algorithm picks the songs perfectly to the mood and the type of songs it picks is just incredible. Most of the time we get surprised byhow it picks the songs to our taste. Annual plan is a bit expensive but its worth taking it for the quality of music Spotify offers. Finally we fell into deep sleep listening to the soothing songs. Spotify has become part of our daily routine. ðŸŽŠðŸŽ¶ðŸ˜ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜´ðŸ˜ƒðŸŽ¶ðŸŽŠ,positive
Ever since the update a month or so back the offline feature to save Playlist does not work. When you click into the downloaded Playlist it's just a blackscreen. Once you get data again it will work but why would I need to preload my Playlist if it's already downloaded. The new changes have also introduced multiple ui bugs without any extra functionality.,negative
"I'm on the galaxy S21 ultra and for some reason atleast three times a day the app crashes upon opening. FIX THIS ISSUE ALREADY, it's been like this for MONTHS.",negative
"I LOVE THIS APP!! I CAN HEAR MY FAV SONGS LIKE EVERYDAY. well, some of the songs I search aren't available j-j. But who cares!? STILL GIVING THIS A 5 STAR!! but i got some problems. And im very confuse how it works. So, i like this song and put it in my playlist, but when i try to play the song. It just play short instead of full song. Can u uum fix dat? Pls. Also, im very confuse abou the song. Everytime I played the song that i search it played a random song not the song. Pls fix :). Thanks",negative
Most excellent Playlist. SPOTIFY ha slayed Pandora and the others. Really cool features too. Make the switch to more variety for those of us that literally listen to music 24/7/365,positive
Where do I start well Spotify was the last musical platform that I added to my music app ecosystem I already have YouTube music and SoundCloud and Spotify has been a welcome addition I love the fact that I have the ability to search for singles remixes and albums from all three what I enjoy doing is opening Spotify and SoundCloud in split screen view and being able to blend and mix between the twoðŸŽ›ï¸,positive
Awesome! Best music streaming service by far!,positive
It's very nice music you listen a your favorite songs,positive
"Great music library, but the app is horrible. More often than not it fails to play downloaded music without wifi, making it useless for commuting",negative
Best app if wanna explore some new songs that you haven't listened already .,positive
"Excellent variety of music tracks, nothing you search you can't find ! I love this app",positive
Fantastic choice of music day and night all year round,positive
It's nice I acc lyk it a lot but I just don't lyk the fact that without premium u can't listen to any song we want,negative
Easy to play music,positive
"Like , I would listen to songs on really I mean really low network connection , but the songs play smooth as butter",positive
Spotify added lyrics to their songs and it's the best thing ever!,positive
I'm only trying to pick a song and while I press it play it's picks a suggested song instead of a song that I was trying to play and I keep on having to do it over and over again and it just keeps on putting a suggested song instead of a song that I already picked so I'm leaving a bad review cause this sucks YouTube music is better,negative
Best music app of all time,positive
The updates have completely screwed UX. The songs don't show as playing nor do the songs being played how on screen when I'm not in app. Become total garbage,negative
Wow,positive
Why is this thing always downloading? I've uninstalled and reinstalled. Cleared cache. Just sits on downloading xx of 50 for days on end.,negative
i cant even listen to my playlist they got a random song playing it's not what i added on my playlist ! Yall changed yall app up for another dollar and its sad . Miss me with Spotify ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¾ðŸ–•ðŸ¾,negative
It is really a good app.but lyrics can be developed,positive
"I started using Spotify about 2 weeks ago. I can choose the genres, artists, and years I want to hear. I can listen on my headphones, or in the car. There's a ton more to explore, but so far, so good!",positive
"This app gets worse with every update. Increasingly clunky to use and really buggy. The play bar disappears all the time, the play symbol is gone all the time and it frequently crashes. I'm really close to cancelling my premium subscription.",negative
"Play bar keeps disappearing, android app is broken, hope they fix it or I'll cancel my subscription",negative
Fantastic limitless music awesome ðŸ‘Œ,positive
"Loved this app for years and have used it since 2015. However, just so happens that the ONE THING I use to make sure I'm putting the right song into a playlist has been removed and supposedly there's no plans to replace it! Thinking about deleting altogether due to the removal of song previews. Sorry Spotify, but this feels like you're just trying to force money out of people to get more premiums bought. Horrid.",negative
It has most the songs you want to hear great app,positive
Amazing music app LIKE it,positive
So rare to find an app that I actually want to use 10hr a day! Great selection wonderful inde selection!,positive
"I am very satisfying for this app, all my favorites music, singer, band, are here and you may select your favorite genre song, which you may want to hearðŸ¥°.",positive
The best app ever I used apple music and then I used SoundCloud and then I loved Spotify Ê•Â´â€¢ á´¥â€¢Ì¥`Ê”,positive
Best! Works when I turn my tablet off and no issues.,positive
It was terrible i can't even play the song i want it keeps taking me to a other one like stop choosing my music i know what i wanna listen to,negative
"Now they've purportedly removed the 10k song limit on users libraries I'll like the app even more. One gripe, I used to be able to play my entire library at random....can't do it anymore without individually adding all my liked songs and albums to a playlist. An arduos task!",negative
"Good , Best music Experience",positive
"This app is HORRIBLE they take advantage of your music when you have no skips by playing ""Suggested Songs"" forcing you to buy Premium the songs and HORRIBLE you have to listen go LONG UNIMPORTANT ADS and thats why im writing an 500 word review they always add to playlist that you just Added and if they take this message down trust me i will make another post no matter what.I say download if you want bit be prepared for the long annoying ads that will await you the second you press download on it",negative
This is very nice music platform i like this app so much.,positive
"The songs are good and all but why does it has so many ads after 1 vid and another also it wont let me play another music if i paused another one, i cant choose which song to play bc i have to shuffle on my playlist, the repeat option aint visible for me anymore(?)",negative
"it was quite amazing, I appreciate your work",positive
"I am a premium user. Firstly, Why there is no space for all downloaded songs(not albums), like all liked songs at one place, I need all downloaded songs at one place. There should be an option to create a playlist of songs from the downloaded songs, I am unable to create a playlist with my downloaded songs, cause there is no option only, getting irritated.",negative
"Since the latest update spotify no longer connects to my car stereo, had no problems up until then, phone is connected but tells me there is no device through Spotify.",negative
Spotify is great but the recent update has been making my app all funky on my phone. Still love the services just wish the app wouldn't crash as much.,negative
Seamless music free wonderful ðŸ‘ â¤,positive
Love the music but some of the podcast that I have Askadely click I can't delete so I would like that to be fix in the next update plz,negative
"Spotify premium is great! Especially the deal where you can get 3 months free, thats pretty cool. The only downside is the non-premium ( i guess thats how youd say that?? Lol) spotify where you can only listen in shuffle, have limited skips, and there's a bunch of ads. But overall i love spotify :)",positive
"Bloated, unorganized, and a data-hog. Features like playlists and favorite artists are cumbersome to navigate and inconsistent.",negative
"u love spotify because Jungkook, V and BTS' songs is there.",positive
Best apps and good idea for the first time,positive
Good for podcast,positive
"great app, just found a student pack paid weekly and its awesome since my pocket s always so skinny",positive
Gotta love free music and podcast. Thank you spotifyðŸ˜,positive
"It's better than iTunes, I can tell you that lol",positive
"I like this app and I don't have premium but it still works fine. The only reason I rated this a 3 was because the ads. The ads are terrible and will literally happen in the middle of a song. But other than that, I recommend!",positive
Very fast and accessable,positive
"Random crashing during my songs are a big no-no and Spotify you have been doing that lately. Also, what is the point of me selecting shuffle, if it's going to shuffle in the same order!?? It's like I know what song will play next on shuffle.. Like seriously. I am about this close to u subscribing and going somewhere else!!",negative
Id recommend if you like music I guess idfk,positive
It's good it's just ads and I'm having troubles getting my Playlist,positive
Great no issues at all,positive
Not as easy to navigate and search as others,negative
Can download songs for offline playing,negative
The new update is horrible. The mini player fails to load. I've lost all music controls both in the app and out of it. Moving outside my vehicle it continues to play at full volume even though I'm not connected to anything. It's full of bugs. It won't even play through a Playlist without crashing now.,negative
"They've just about ruined this app. Super buggy. Unintuitive UI. Half the time, the play button doesn't work. I have to force stop the app to get it to work again. And their recent changes to accessing podcasts and downloads makes finding downloaded episodes so incredibly comicated. The old way was so much better. I have no idea who's making these decisions but they have horrible designers. Edit. They've somehow made this worse. No podcasts work anymore. Offline mode doesn't work half the time.",negative
Excellent at all times,positive
"It's fantasticðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ mostly the way it access, facilitate and save your music with a even lesser data. It's a great experience ðŸ¤ž",positive
The app is good it has most of the music I want to hear well done,positive
Everything is paid,positive
"All my favourite music can been played here,thanks!",positive
This app spreads COVID misinformation. They're losing a lot of great artists because of their mishandlings.,negative
"Since mid May 2022, I can't play anything on Spotify. All of my playlists are either empty or have like 2 songs on them. Even official Spotify playlists are empty. Edited: There's been 4 updates since this post and I still can't listen to any music. I pay for this and I can't use it. The website works but I can't download a playlist there so I have to use my mobile data. I'll be switching to Pandora, I guess. I prefer Spotify but I can't use it! ðŸ˜¡",negative
"The worst app I've had to use, love spotify but what's the point if I can't ever use it. I pay for premium just for the app to be nonfunctional for half the month because either my phone or spotify updated and now it just doesn't work. Nope still broken",negative
This a great app the only thing is that when I want to play a song it will play a totally different one.,negative
Great app has all of my favorite music choices,positive
It is so frustrating. Why 6 skips per hour? You are so mean!,negative
"Use to have beats that then turned in apple music,(which did not like at all) found out about Spotify and do not regret getting it.",positive
"Spotify has the simplest way to save a song. Just tap the little heart outline which then turns green. You'll have a thousand songs in your ""liked"" catagory before you know it. After you've gotten sick of some of them, tap the little heart again and it's gone.",negative
Spotify a good app try it All are perfect lovely app Easy to use,positive
"Simple to navigate and an endless supply of content however 9nce you 0ay for the service and start downloading content you can't play ""offline content"" if your subscription terminates due to a delinquent payment.",negative
Very easy to use and wide selection of artists,positive
The only place i listen to music phenominal app,negative
When playing songs it stops randomly. Ive checked the settings and adjusted accordingly. I have no problem with other apps just Spotify.,positive
I really hate it when they give you 6 skips an hour but when you make a playlist they automatically add a bunch of random songs to your playlist and another thing is even when you remove the songs from your playlist they keep playing. I dont know if this is some random glitch but please spotify work on this.,negative
Been using Spotify for over a year and still great. Thanx,positive
I give only one star because too much of ad... After every song 1 mins ad... Too much of ad... It's irritating... .,negative
The only problem I have had was that sometimes I would play a song and a random song would start playing. But overall it's very fun and useful especially because you can exit the app and still hear the music unless your on an app that uses audio. Great app definitely recommend,positive
I love this app! I only wish it were easier to like AND dislike songs to tell the app to never play songs again.,positive
Easy to use. Wide range of music and podcast.,positive
I used to love this app but now that you can't see the songs in the playlist I just don't like it,negative
Every idea you guys come up with now is terrible. What did you do? Partner with Netflix?! STOP ASKING FOR BLUETOOTH CONNECTION!!!!!!!!!,negative
Excellent music,positive
Is just a great music app in general,positive
Bad experience with the latest update. Choppy connection with my car. Songs get cut off. Song titles do not appear. Playlists stops suddenly.,negative
App having nice song collection But the app shows partiality in treating languages. When hearing Hindi songs lyrics comes in Hindi script However while hearing Tamil songs lyrics comes in English script. If Tamil songs lyrics also comes in Tamil script. It will be ðŸ˜Š.,positive
"Many Genres, greet selections!",positive
"This app streams music in you're liked songs Playlist. It plays suggested songs and I get that it's trying to introduce me to new music, if I wanted that would just listen to the radio. It goes against what it claims it's meant to be used for",negative
It's perfect. You can play whatever you want without ads. I mean anything!!!,positive
Very pleased with spotify,positive
"Spotify isnt showing what's playing and doesn't give me any control of what is. When my screen locks, anything playing turns off. It's super annoying, does anyone know how to fix this?",negative
Used Spotify since it was still in beta and free tehe Always loved it Listening several hours daily I also really like the small extra things like Discover Weekly and the yearly Wrapped etc,positive
"Stop asking to control my Bluetooth, you've never needed it before and I can decide what connects to my phone like I always have.",positive
What a f..k. Why it is turn off within a song. I have to open it and play that song from beginning always ðŸ™„. It's frustrating. Can you guys help me out,negative

From which day I have download this app Spotify from that day I am interest to listen musics and I like this App a lot thank you.,positive

I tried to use the playlists I made, it's shuffled and adds a random song that idk!!!! But this one thing I discovered is that when I'll use the PC version and the phone version at the same account and at the same time, the phone works perfectly fine, like a remote tho... I hated this pls fix...",negative
     spotify      best app ,positive
Im happy with this app radio so far its great,positive
Very energetic,positive
Good App Good Quality Songs,positive
"The following review is coming from a hardcore audiophile. I've been using Spotify for the last 2 years but didn't get the premium since I believed it was too expensive for just listening to audio. Many times I had thought of switching to other music apps, but once you go Spotify you won't go back. No other music app can hold a candle to Spotify in terms of UI, recommendations and music stock. Eventually I subscribed to the student premium using my stipend money. I haven't regretted it since.",negative
So far I'm happy with the app - it gives good service..keep up the good work.,positive
Spotify is good experience as is. Joe Rogan podcasts and the music are great.,positive
I don't like This app Because ads are coming,negative
It was quite good in the begning  But now there are much ads and now the music cant be change and ads cant be skip,positive
"The apps player window keeps disappearing randomly resulting in having to crash the program to get it back. The review podcast option never allows a review because it states I need to play a few first before I can, but I've listened to every episode on my phone. The most annoying thing however is I work in areas to little to no signal so I download podcasts and music, but Spotify needs an active connection to produce the list of my saved content which defeats this purpose making it useless.",negative
Great app 10 out of 10 not a bot I swear,negative
"I'm not sure it's a bug but on Spotify free when i press shuffle songs in an album, Spotify turns songs from completely different artists",negative
"Been having trouble with downloading podcasts. I never had an issue before but after the recent update I've been having issues, the downloading icon shows but then it just continues to be stuck downloading with no progress.",negative
The now playing/media control bar has started to randomly disappears after a while if the app has been backgrounded and you cant get it back unless u fc the app ðŸ‘Ž Edit: still broken ill make my own instead,negative
"I've used Spotify for seven years I believe and the only issues I had were on my old phone when it would tell me my playlist wasn't downloaded when it was then when I got wifi again, it went back to saying it was downloaded. That's the only issues I've had.",negative
Love the app but even my internet connection is good also the app tells you're OFFLINE CAN YOU DO SOMETHING SPOTIFY,positive
The app never works on my samsung s9. It keeps stopping before I can even open the damn thing. Even after updating.,negative
It helped me handle stress better. It relieves my soul when i listen to inspirational talks and songs,positive
"Spotify is awesome as a service. I literally signed up because of Joe Rogan. I've been thinking about it ever since Rogan and Spotify signed their deal, but their adherence to their contract despite controversy sealed the deal. The user interface for the app isn't exactly intuitive. It is challenging to get back and forth into the queue versus a play list versus an album that I'm looking at. I would maybe suggest multiple tabs that are easy to access.",negative
It's fun to listen to music and relax,positive
"Didn't like the new update. I can't even put a song on repeat anymore. It's all on ""shuffle mode"" and I don't enjoy it. I'm switching over to Pandora until they fix this",negative
Perfect listening. Found exactly what I wanted.,positive
Music quality is the best!!! Can't live without it.,positive
There should be no ads at all. Premium dosent make sence but it's ok,positive
Cool it's just cool you can listen to your favorite songs and every song it just depends if it's on there it most likely is though,positive
Good playlist compaliation With vast genres,positive
"If you want to listen hindi songs in daily mix list, it's not possible as you mix other languages song which is very annoying",negative
"im gonna give it 4 stars for rn because of the ads. Amazing app but whenever i play an album or song, i get 3-7 different ads and it fets really annoying. im not planning on buying premium either because i dont want to. and also i have a request. Why dont you make the spotify app for phones the same it is as the web player or tablet? i want to change my songs directly without shuffle mode or going to the next song in my playlist. please consider it but overall great app",positive
"Exceptional app, I really enjoy it because is easy to use.",positive
"Very good, except difficult to contact someone if I have a question or an issue",positive
Best of the best music access app listed online.,positive
This is nice app i love spotify,positive
"My go to music app, first started using it years ago because no connection was needed to hear my playlists and I have never strayed.",positive
"3 stars, would be 4 or more if they just implemented Spotify hifi. Is that too much to ask?",negative
Best application for music..loved itðŸ˜,positive
"Lately when I have had music playing, it won't show in my notification bar so I can't switch the song. When I go into the app it shows I've got nothing playing even when I do.",negative
I am not good with words but I will say this is a great app. would recommend,positive
"Its Spotify. Massive song selection, shares music across platforms and social media easily. But I'm very frustrated with the player (pause, skip forward/back). It stops working within 10 minutes of me playing audio, so I can't pause it; I have to shut the app down to stop the audio. Even then, it doesn't start working again when I start the app back up, I have to restart my phone for that. So for now this app is less functional than most music apps and barely beats the radio, except I pay for it",negative
I love spoyify but I can't download songs on my phone,negative
Had it with Pandora it was glitchy played lists on top of each other and the sound quality through the car was terrible Opened this app up sounded amazing and a whole lot easier to use Going to subscribe right after this,positive
Good,positive
Excellent and always meets my expectations a must haveðŸ‘,positive
The AI in Spotify is the most atractive thing across all other music player platform. Personaly i have a apple music subscription even though I use Spotify because to show respect for the AI creater dev team for Spotify ðŸ’“ and also good music suggestion tho thank you Spotify ðŸ’“ðŸ’“. My personal suggestion:- Ads should be not personal (Spotify premium ad) but use Google ads then we to intersted in ads like YT ads yeah I know it takes some percent from ad generated profit but it isgreat monetis,negative
"App is great, i can listen to songs i very like but i have one problem in this app well i cant play musics through mobile but i can play songs in computer or in tv. This has been going on for a month. I have to shuffle my playlist in order to play musics, but sometimes it misses my favorite songs. Even if i click the song it'll just play shortly Or the best part of the song, I didn't know if there was any updates, so please. Fix this :/",negative

The new update is honestly terrible. Listening on a remote device doesn't work at all anymore and sometimes the skip and pause interface just disappears. Please ffs fix it!!,negative
I used to love Spotify because it doesn't take much data and even play songs when data gets exhausted. But from about one week it has been using a lot of data and becuz of this reason I'm unable to listen songs cuz I'm a student and nowadays online classes are going on so I can't waste my data on listening to songs. So please make sure your app doesn't use much data because it's really disappointing ðŸ˜¢.,negative
I absolutely love Spotify,positive
The best. I can play music wherever i want and whenever i want. I can search for beautiful music instantly.,positive

"Does not play liked music, and after you get the 30 min of ad free music it hits you with 30 min of ads. Legit a broken app",negative
Love Spotify â¤ I can find anything and everything I want. I particularly like the myriad political podcasts and am a big fan of Older and Wider too. The music available at the tap of a few keys is superb and all above and more keep me marching around the Hampshire countryside on a daily basis. Thank you Spotify ðŸ˜Š an integral part of my daily life.,positive
"App usually is great, but latest version is super buggy, when music plays the bottom control bar goes away and you can see or control what is playing. Super disappointing",negative
This app went to garbage in just a week. Everything is buggy and terrible.,negative
"Some other Malawian (I am a Malawian by the way) so some other Malawian songs can not be found on this, but I love the fact that you provide so many albums of those that you are able to",positive
"Add the ability to clear ur play queue, or auto clear it after a length of time(make this non premium, please) and maybe add more skips for us non premium havers",negative
Bluetooth disonnect and playing needs work. When disconnected from the car or other devices music continues to play. The now playing half the time doesn't show in the app either this requires force kill to correct and even at that time doesn't always correct. Very irritating as I have a paid service!,negative
The app keeps crashing,negative
Spotify is one of the best music apps on this planet! There are absolutely NO ads! Nothing gets in the way of Spotify's music!,positive
My play button and previous/next buttons are all messed up after One of the recent updates. The pause/play button is all the way to the right with the back/next buttons pushed all the way to the left. Ugly and a little unsettling.,negative
"Can't connect to my car since the last update, but I can play the music through the Bluetooth setting, also lost the icon on the lock screen to jump statist back in to Spotify after using other apps, this is on android (s21)",negative
What happened to the player? I assume it's disappearance is due to a bug? Why does playback it keep randomly stopping - which is even more annoying without a player to easily start it again.,negative
Ive been using this app for a long time but recently ever time i get the 30 min of add free music the app crashes and i end up with adds,negative
The best of streaming music apps. My favorite thing about Spotify is how it automatically extends whatever Playlist you have been listening too with the same sort of music.,positive
i dont like it for example you only get 6 skips an HOUR i hate that plus i cant copy the album:/ fix it now,negative
"Love Spotify, My favorite Music App",positive
Having problem evey time when I try to login and some times show network error in search section. Please solve these problems ðŸ˜’ And there is too many adds.,negative

"I love spotify but i don't like the fact that to play my playlist i need to shuffle it. I also cant go back so i cant play the song before which is weird. The ""liked"" playlist is a one song play now because eveeytime i listen to something it doesn't play the next song. And it shows the name of the song and artist, it doesn't show the albam cover anymore which is also weird. Im not sure if it's only because im a new user to spotify it's doing that but that gave me one reason to uninstall spotify.",negative
"""Music to my ears"" Awesome!! Soooo Cool! ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ‘ðŸ‘",positive
I do like to being able to do a variety in of things on the app but why can't I watch the music videos?! That would've be made it awesome to me,positive

Too much of disturbing ads,negative
"I've used Spotify for years, and I've never really had issues with it until recently. I can't play any songs, my playlists don't show on my library, and when I do pull up my playlists they show as having no songs. I contacted support and nothing they instructed me to do helped in the slightest. This has happened since the latest update to my phone a few days ago, rendering this app completely obsolete. Fix it.",negative
"If I have to download my library one more time, I'm canceling my premium subscription. * I did redownload 6 more times. Enough is enough.",negative
"It's a great app and the best mp3 music app I have ever used but there is one problem that, why can't we play some songs or find some songs? despite this the app is wonderful I recommend it. it's just the best.",positive

"Recent update broke the app. Active Playing bar vanishes frequently, music jitters and stops, songs disappear from my library etc etc. And then they have the guts to ask me to rate them, well here i am!",negative
Best app for music might use one of marvelous of alll,positive
the blend feature isn't working and i have tried everything to fix it. extremely disaappinted since i even pay for premium. hope they fix it otherwise I will unsubscribe,negative
I've used Spotify for years and I definitely recommend it to everyone because whever you're there for songs or podcasts it has everything and it is very engaging with how it creates playlists of songs new and old that you've listened to. 5 stars you should download now.,positive
Provide a option for detecting songs,positive
So easy to use and has a wide selection of songs to listen to but if you don't have premium you get ads interrupting you between each song every 5 minutes,negative
Was nice..But dissapointing was that there was no lyrics for some of the sonds... But nice ðŸ‘ liked the app ðŸ‘,positive
"Music plays in good quality. Easy to make custom playlists. The premium plan is affordable. Downloads can be played offline without issue. The voice search functionality which works fine. Overall, this is a good app.",positive
Why do I need premium to listen to my favorite music,negative
Since I updated the app won't open.,negative
Love the app but why can't Android have drag down gesture for player window like Ios. It's so annoying i have 6.67 inch display and i have to use 2 hands to drop the player window. Other issue I face is that application cold boot is way long like 8-10 seconds long why is it like that?,negative
Awsome app and features But add light mode and dark mode switching option,negative
After each song the Chand baliyan song ad playing its getting irritated ðŸ˜¤....please fix this,negative

I like because you can still listen to your music when you are in the middle of playing your games,positive
Best for music lovers and podcast listeners,positive
Don't pay the 10 bucks it's not worth it. My music always stops playing at the most random times and it's been happening a little more often lately. This is really starting to irritate me.,negative
I have been very happy with this app over the years and pay for premium which has been awesome for working in areas without service and still keeping my music library accessible! I have noticed that the ability to change songs from my lock screen seems to have disappeared about 6 months ago and most recently the music has had steady glitches in playing where a 2 second gap of music has been occurring as when i leave the app occasianly the controls for the current song seem to be gone. S20FE,negative
Next time I set an alarm I really don't want to wake up to some random drum and base instead of what I set to wake me up.,negative
1. In areas of poor reception Spotify continually fails to show downloaded songs and requests to connect to internet (what's the point in downloading songs if Spotify doesn't show them). 2. Pay your artists more per stream.,negative
"App doesn't perform well, but I like the layout and the features",positive
"Good, we can enjoy all new and old songs. Where we found lot of collection to satisfy music lovers is this app.once we enter to music world of Spotify we forgot the environment and souroundings by searching.",positive

"Spotify is more beneficial with premium account, no adds, create your own playlist, track selection of your choice, super easy to use and reasonably priced..",positive
Music keeps stopping for no reason. App doesn't show the track currently played. My downloaded playlists keep on trying to get downloaded but are only partly available offline... Very frustrating.,negative
"I LOVE this app! One complaint is you should be able to put a song on repeat,and it shouldnt put ""recomended"" songs in your playlist. Other than that 5 star rating! A must have app.",negative
"I really love listen to music with this app. Specially the artist's radios, but I have had a problem recently. I can't liste music at the same time I'm in whatsapp. Maybe it's problem because of my phone, but it's annoying.",negative
Moving on up... with the top tunes and podcasts. Thx EZEmixilogistmmm,positive
"Used to love this app.. the 30 minutes without interruption. good times. now it's an ad every 1-2 songs. I barely use this app anymore because of it. and when it says ""30 minutes without interruption"" it's actually just 4 songs then like 10 ads straight.",negative
"Great source for your podcast needs. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 star is they only do video for Rogan, and it freezes and crashes with his podcast from time to time. When it happens hard to fix",negative
I have used this app from a very long time and I didn't had any issues but nowadays why does it have so much ads I mean literally too much I only listen two or three songs but again it comes with ads not only one but two of minimum 30 seconds and in the end those ads are about premium . don't know how you guys come up with those numerous ideas just about premium which irritating.I mean it's ok to have ads but nowadays it's too much ads only.Hope this will be decreased other than that it's good,negative
"It's been 2 weeks or more of the app showing no internet connection yet I have plenty of data and I can't access all the content of my playlists, it keeps behaving like I am not on premium yet it's renewed every month without fail. And oh, it doesn't show lyrics either which was the first odd thing then came the ""no internet connection"" which keeps constantly reflecting on my screen",negative
Now are days hearing to many ad even in 30 minutes at least 3-4 ad just like one song one ad. But primer is good. Low price also,positive
"It's nice when l don't want to watch TV I have a great selection of music oldies and modern to listen to, goes with my moods brilliant",positive
Spotify Premium customer for about 8 years. I don't like not owning my music but this is absolutely the best alternative. Wonderful eclectic catalogue. Super reliable streaming. So long as they continue to be a free speech platform I'll love them. Six stars if I could.,positive
Spotify should be free like on Consoles. Only Offline Music should be in the subscription.,negative
"This app suddenly stopped working. When try to play a song, it plays another random song. I don't know what is wrong with Spotify business team. Such a third class product.",negative
Ads included . I would prefer to buy Spotify,negative
The best app ever for streaming music ðŸ”¥,positive
"Bugging like mad lately. Especiay of connected to Bluetooth, you can't skip or pause songs, and it will randomly just stop playing or disconnect for no reason, on multiple different bluetooth devices. I pay Â£9.99 a month for what is quickly becoming a useless and frustrating app. Going to cancel subscription if issues aren't identified and sorted asap.",negative
Slow to operate is my most frustrating complaint. Recommends same songs over and over. discorery weekly is half bands ive already heard and have saved albums of. Recommendations could be better for sure.,negative
"Only gripe is a bug in the notifications navigator bar. It would stay stuck on one track sometimes. Restarting the app and playing a new track will add both tracks to the bar, letting you swipe between the two. But controlls for both will only playback the most recent track.",negative
Yes I am satisfied with Spotify but at a certain time the ads will become so annoying (not in premium) except that it's a wonderful music app,negative
"Downloaded playlist and titles often wont load in in offline mode, thats incredibly frustrating. otherwise its okey working, minor bugs and crashes.",negative
Nice app if you are a music lover. All the best team Spotify. Pls add some more hindi film songs old albums.,positive
Iy is a very nice app . But i have one problem that some lirycs are not avaliable like on song abcdefu there are no lryics and some lryics are not fully or wrongly written like on payphone song. So i hope you will fix it btw a very nice app,negative
"the recommended songs just annoys me, i just wanna listen to the songs i have on the playlist yet it just plays different songs that isn't even in my playlist, there was this one song that wasn't even in my playlist yet it said it was in it, i checked the playlist and it wasn't even there. This update just sucks not gonna lie",negative
Super great app that play with each of your vybes,positive
Unlimited music. Awesome. Enjoy.,positive

It's a great app. Whatever music I want whenever I want it.,positive
Best MUSIC APP in the WORLD!!! Love it,positive
"I refrained from giving 5 stars only because of the ads, otherwise the app is the best. Recently there are too many ads, hope they would work on it. Edit : I've finally got the premium subscription. Feels good to not have to listen to the irritating ads",positive
"What is actually going on with this app? It's absolutely terrible!!!! Freezing every single song. Ads on premium, Losing the ""now playing"" constantly unresponsive, and just plain garbage.",negative
"App and service continues to get worse. Latest update broke the playback and make music randomly pause. This update was released 9 days ago, and still has not been fixed. Also this is a music app, why are podcasts being put above music on the home screen?",negative
Awesome! There's no end to the song choices and what a great and easy way to make your various playlists! Best of there!!!,negative

"I love it, better than pandora and I love it even more it have subtitles (the Words)add with music for people who wear cochlear implant users or hard of hearing or deaf, so Spotify for keeping up the great work.",positive
"As of April 13, 2022, theh removed the 30 second preview when trying to add songs to a playlist when using the ""add songs"" function in a playlist. This is upsetting because it practically removes any way to discover similar songs to what you already have in a playlist. 2 stars because everything else is great, but this is really upsetting. If they bring this feature back it's easily 5, but honestly without that feature it makes it basically impossible to create a decent playlist.",negative
Ok it's great but I have to pay inorder to skip songs,negative
This app has solved lots of problems to people around the world and is also very helpful ...thus is a great and very reliable app,positive
"The days of MP3s and Wav files seem like they're finally gone. It's kind of sad, but with features like listening with your friends on Discord, and Spotify's algorithm to recommend artists, I've listened to three times the amount of music that I used to. I will stay premium likely for years to come.",negative
"This app is good and best to me,i kinda like it.What i dont like it when the songs changes to song recommendations.I heard that your playlist needs to be long,a lot songs.Well,i had this one 2hr long playlist but then suddenly the songs i dont really like appears.Dont make my anger went up until i uninstall this app,okay?(sorry for my bad english but i hope you understand)",positive
"Doesn't practice their own rules. Not OK to allow your ""star"" to spread misinformation but block others for the same reasons. Do better.",negative
Though I listen to the music.. But Podcasts in this app are amazing.especially Neelesh Misra's podcast,positive
"Flawless, love everything about it, I've converted people from Pandora and other services to Spotify love the duo account great for me and my wife ðŸ‘ðŸ‘",positive
I love this app. No problem about ads because it gives 30 min of uninterrupted music also very frequently ðŸ¤©,positive
"I'm about ready to cancel my Spotify account. Really getting fed up with the working one day, not working the next or it just shuts down. Today, I couldn't listen to any of my music while offline. I uninstalled the app, reinstalled & rebooted the phone but it still didn't work. Now that I'm home, I find I have to download all my playlists yet again. I pay for premium service, but don't get it. Not such a premium app.",negative
Having an awesome time using Spotify,positive
YouR NeVR AlOnE Best of 1 of MiNe,positive
Why would they put the play/pause button to the left of the Previous/Next Song options? The world doesn't make sense anymore. This is absurd.,negative
Works great if you ain't broke lol,positive
I love spotify I can listen to my favorite songs wherever whenever and its great.,positive
I am very very happy with this and spotify i just suggest add more podcast and others,positive
It's fine. I just don't like it when it puts stuff in my playlists,positive
Excellent. I had Amazon but cancelled and switched to Spotify.,negative
Best music app available ( for discover music). But there still a lot of areas to improve.,positive
Why am I listening to songs that aren't on my playlist which is leading me to skipping so I can actually hear what I want and that's wasting skips ðŸ˜,negative
Its good but could improve more,positive
Image free version pls!! It would be nice for my teen to be able to use Spotify without seeing all the images. Teens are not necessarily in the same age group as the kids spotify. So they want to listen to latest artists...but they don't need to be seeing adult images that are often too graphic.,negative
"Pixel 4, Android V12. Spotify has always been my music player of choice, but the app is unusable. The currently playing beat at the bottom had vanished and the music will randomly stop halfway through a song.",negative
super easy to use and over all a great app,positive

"Listen,Spotify is a great app, I've been using it for over 3 years,the people on here say 'it plays random songs not from my playlist' usually that is with a normal subscribtion. I highly recommend getting premium,if I'm not mistaken a family package is around R99pm.It is amazing and I really enjoy Spotify and their music!",positive

Great! All the music I want.,positive
Some many ads,negative
This app is amazing but have to delete because wouldn't let me,negative
Way too unstable and buggy on Android 12. Not enough options for customisation. The change from showing album covers to showing artist background images when playing through a TV was a terrible decision. It's ridiculous that a service this big with this much money behind it has actually become worse during the years.,negative
Fantastic app performance as to listening loved songs,positive
"Good music app ðŸ‘ You can listen offline or online and make playlists with songs you like . You can also find playlists and podcasts, I recommend getting this app :)",positive
"So it's a wonderful app, but it glitches often. I have to uninstall, then reinstall every couple of weeks.",negative
It's amazing no 1 app to listen a music with good quality,positive
Excellent company Your library is just wonderful My favorite music appThanks,positive
The new update is very bad.I can just hear a few seconds of my songs in my playlist,negative
"I really enjoy using Spotify, the fact that I can seamlessly switch from my PC to my phone to my echo dot and my queue and song pick up from where they leave off is just superb. I pay for a family account as it seems better than just paying half the price for just myself. I have my parents and brothers enjoying with me. Also the listening parties, absolutely amazing feature. I have one MAJOR issue. Why is there no swipe to queue for Android? It's been a feature since 2015 on iphone.",positive
"Spotify picks random times to update what I assume are my downloaded playlists every day, but it keeps getting stuck at 95-97% unless I manually open and then force close the app. Update: been over a month and still no fix. Dropping down to one star.",negative
I want to listen to one song but I have to watch a minute of adds then I plays a completely different song from another singer,negative
Why do i have less songs then before and trying to recover them and they can't play wth is this,negative
It assumes I like to listen to the same type of music all of the time,negative
"There's a problem when adding music to playlists, it doesn't allow you to preview the songs anymore.",negative
It adds musics that i dont want to listen,positive
"App freezes, controls disappearing from the screen, awful podcast and artist recommendations with no way to block them... I am very ready to abandon the premium I pay for and go back to sailing the seas",negative
"My spotify suddenly started bugging out, I have to open the app a lot of times before it starts working normally as it keeps on crashing. Hope this could be solved",negative
It has very good music and great playlists but sometimes i feel like rewinding the song but i can't,negative
The best without ads I mean with and without the best,positive
"Kind of new to using music apps, but so far so good, after several weeks using it.",positive
It is good....but there are Soo many ads and also there are no old songs,negative
"Very easy to use. Spotify makes Playlists suited to your music tastes, mood, occasions, activities, etc. Ads are infrequent and short. I highly recommend this app!",positive
Fantastic app it has all the music you want.,positive

Very nice app I get all the songs without give money and with very less ad,negative
"Easy to use, wonderful selection,",positive
"They know what I like, and they always deliver the best,.",positive
Spotify is a perfect app for music so in my opinion you should install it it has a lot of songs and stuff.,positive
"1) Has the worst shuffle algorithm I've ever seen. 2) App has become a mess of late, with slow load times and visual inconsistencies. 3) Insists on pinning on my homepage random albums/artists/podcasts from which I played one song/episode ages ago - keeping the likes of Discover Weekly and Release Radar out of sight. Spotify is a good service with a dreadful mobile app.",negative
"Good app, but you have to pay to preview songs when making a playlist now.",negative
Bluetooth is really bad about updating the device it's playing too. Other streaming services have no issue. Unstable updates seem to cause crashes regularly. Podcasts are a stupid addition to a music app.,negative
"Love the app but lately, As of yesterday, the song play/pause/like thing at the bottom regularly disappears making it impossible to change songs or pause. It also not on my lock screen like usual. I mean maybe reinstalling could fix it, but devs should fix the bug without us having to do it ðŸ›",negative
"When it works, it's great. Most days it will only play 2-3 songs completely, then the first 10s of everything else.",negative
Very bad app within 2 songs they presenting advertisement. Comparatively Jio Saavn is better atleast in that app we could listen nearly 10 songs without any advertisements and no subscription ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡.. Also how Spotify can think that we should pay money on these subscriptions to listen without advertisements. Please remove ads.......,negative
It's a good app but downloading songs shouldn't be a premium luxury As a broke student with no income its an inconvenience not to be able to listen to music offline,negative
Better sound,positive
at least its not slow like the desktop version,positive
It is one of the most beautiful applications I have ever known It is free and contains all the songs that I listen to,positive
The best streaming music ever!,positive
"bug; when opening the app and playing music it will begin to play without a play bar, have to close the app and reopen to get it to function properly please fix edit: its doing this again pls make it stop",negative
Would more options of continues play instead of just one episode,negative
"Used to be good. It dont let me play my playlists, pause, stop, start and go back a track from my phone (samsung). I emailed spotify and asked help from a member but nothings working.",negative
I love all the songs and the app is surprisingly fast on my 6 year old phone. And it rickrolled me!,positive
"huge let down, went on several fligths, never managed to download music for offline listening, says no internet connection and no songs can be played.",negative
"Got all my favorites and more, convenient too... could not ask for more",positive
Its fine for the most part. Some songs are there but won't play. Very intrusive ads during podcasts(pretty sure i have a paid subscription. Not easy to skip ads either. Gives a platform to people spreading misinformation during a global health crisis.,negative
Good,positive
If you consider adding substitel then it will be very helpful,positive
"When I go to a radio station, I don't want to listen to the same songs on my Playlist over and over again. Even my daily soundtracks are just songs from my main Playlist I listen to. I want something new, something interesting, not just the same songs over and over again shoved down my throat. I went through and hid all the songs on my Playlist in the last radio station I listened to and it was more then half my Playlist.",negative
There's an issue with my phone and I absolutely CANNOT get my app icons on my screen. I've tried and still unable to open spotify even after uninstalling and reinstalling it again. It only gives me the option to uninstall the app again and the icon will not pop up. What can I do??,negative
Great app overall. It's just hard to get it to stop playing certain songs completely. Like I have to consistently remove songs I dislike from suggested playlists.,positive
"three stars because the app is uncomfortable to use without premium, i can't even pick a song i want to listen and can only skip 6 songs",negative
Similar to other people - it seems to constantly be randomly stopping in the middle of songs and won't play I the background,negative
"Recommended audio apps, various types of audio are available. Even rare religious one. Salute!",positive
"Just migrated from Apple music. Not bad so far. I like the whole playlist thing but tbh it's a bit of an issue (like for when I wanna delete a song entirely that I put on multiple playlists). Also I really dislike the queue. I mean on Apple music on my queue page I can see next songs and previous songs together with their album art, I really loved that. And Spotify's lyrics page is a bit... Lacking. The fact that I can add local files on my Spotify is a huge bonus tho. Would update this later.",negative
"Spotify needs to make it easier to delete duplicates in playlists. But love their enhancement option for playlist. Spotify, when are you gonna create a dj mixing capability for playlists? It would be game changing. . . ;)",negative
Love it so far i can type in artist and fet all their songs i love.,positive
Until today all my playlists and saved songs have disapeard for no reason even when i go on spotifys own playlists nothing is there its stressing me out,negative
"App is great, would be a 5* but they changed the group session for some reason and now it takes about 50 extra steps to use and hardly works!",negative
A great app with all the best music,positive
Great selection of music.,positive
It logged me out when and wouldn't let log back into my account because I jad it in offline mode,negative
"Spotify keeps stopping mid song after I start. Happens sometimes every song, sometimes every 3rd but always happens. I'm the only one who uses it, cleared cache, uninstall and reinstalled, dont use power saving mode ever, have perfect Internet, deleted all my data and saved and started over and it CONTINUES to happen. I PAY for this, if its not fixed in the next couple of days I'm cancelling my subscription because this is pathetic at best.",negative
I love Spotify â¤ music because it provides all the albums for us. One thing about Spotify it has all no lie. I really do appreciate it very much.,positive
"App is broke, music won't stop or display played song currently. Also if you switch apps and go back it won't play or app may crash. My whole family is having the same issue. App was ok before and didn't do this",negative
Add some more advertisements so we can enjoy your advertisements without playing the songs,negative
"With every update this app seems to get worse. Frequent crashes are very annoying. Often when I pick something to play, the app will say ""Spotify is trying to play..."" but it is playing the audio I want, but without the controls to pause/fast-forward/rewind being available. To fix this I have to close the app multiple time and re open it. Spotify is awesome, but the app flat out sucks now.",negative
"Thank God Spotify has integrity. At the moment, they do not stand for cencorship. I use this app mostly for podcast but it also fulfill my musical preferences. Better than YouTube imo.",positive
"So many bugs. Doesn't work smoothly in airplane mode, when you should still be able to listen to downloaded episodes. Also crashes occasionally.",negative
Very nice all music,positive
"Oh my God new version is TRASH. 90% of the time it will be playing something but it won't register as anything playing so I can't pause, fast forward, save to likes, etc. Downgraded to previous apk until they fix this mess",negative
Very good App - All the music - old and new that you would love to listen to.,positive
"I've been experiencing lots of little bugs lately. Sometimes it resets my progress on a podcast. Sometimes it marks a podcast as played when I only listened to five minutes. It doesn't communicate with my car very well anymore, so the radio display shows the first song in a Playlist and not the current song. I have to close and restart almost any time I switch devices. When it works, it works great. But I hope they get this stuff working again soon.",negative
"Love Spotify! Hands down the best and easiest to use subscription radio for your $$! So much better than Apple music by far. As long as they are in business, they will have a customer in me",negative
Been having issues for over a week now just crashes everytime I use it and I have already uninstalled and reinstalled it a couple of times and updated it,negative
Love it works great in my car.,positive
There is an issue while trying to play Bbc world service podcasts. Can't play any of the bbc podcasts. I believe many of the listeners already raised this issue. Kindly fix this issue.,negative
I like spotify it is good . Pls put new songs on it .,positive
It's a lovely app but mode of payment is exhausting especially for Nigeria,negative
I absolutely like Spotify because I can turn off my screen and Spotify still playing. Unlike You Tube Music. Thanks Spotify ðŸ‘,positive
It keeps taking over my phone and car and auto playing stuff. Even though I turned autoplay off it continues to insist on autoplaying stuff and overriding SiriusXM 8n the car,negative
"Love the app, only wish it had playback speed like YouTube has, a good few songs that I ha e sound a lot better at a certain speed. How this could get fixed in the next update please and thank you.",negative
"Loved it before! but now I can't preview any of the songs in my add songs section. So I can't put anything new in my playlists. Not cool, please fix",negative
Great for Spotify,positive
Not much ads and good podcasts are there.,negative

Very very very bad app i trail 1 day premium and download 30 song but next day song gone and not shows me my download song,negative
I love this app because you can listen to a bunch of cool songs including your favitorite songs or artis i love u so much spotify!! (: the resion i reted the ads a one is because their annoying and because i hate ads alot (:,positive
This app have very good international song collection.,positive
Can't open the app anymore. What the heck is going on?,negative
I love it it's easy to find the song you looking for rather it was back in the days or nowadays.,positive
"great app, I have premium and love the offline listening. Really enjoy being able to make my own playlists",positive
"Update: This app is becoming more and more terrible, may move to other streaming service soon. Original post: Thanks for reminding me to review Spotify. This app has gone really downhill lately and pretty much every update is accompanied by bugs, songs not playing, queues disappearing, new features not working.... Focus on getting the basics of music playing right rather than unnecessary features that no one cares about.",negative
Loved this app in the beginning. I could choose where I wanted my playlist to start off at... Now that you have updated the app I can no longer do that... On my tablet I have the older version of Spotify where I can pick the song that I want to start with... I just wish it was back to the way it was before this update that they had.... Still love the app though.,positive
Can you guys increase your streaming but rate even higher so we can get better sound quality.,negative
Oh my god! I am using this app for almost 2 years. This app is amazing a d I took premium of it and now it's sound quality is above than any other app! I think this is the future of music apps. I recommend you guys to plz buy premium at least buy a mini pack and try it. I took premium of 6months after listening some music on this app. Amazing app deserves 5 star definitely.,positive
These is just really good that I don't even have words for it,positive
Since my podcast is on here I am learning a great deal how to us the platform even for my favorite music.,positive
I'm not sure if anyone has been having similar issues but basically since March the app has been freezing and crashing. It won't load artwork and it takes five minutes for a song to load. I'm a very busy person who doesn't have time to wait for a song to load every time I turn on the app. I have switched to YouTube premium with music until Spotify gets it together. I have used it exclusively for the last five years but the app performance is so bad that I finally canceled my premium sub.,negative
"Generally a good app, but recent update was super buggy (no ""playing now"" section, music pauses for few sec every minute or so), and no ""backward patch"" was released despite the fact that it was released 2 weeks ago",negative
Wouldn't use any other music service!,negative
"Whenever I head to my liked songs and play a specifc one, it'll only play for a few seconds.",negative
"Very easy to use, Easy to navigate, easy to make a playlist, and then find it and add stuff to a playlist. This is the first time I've ever used Spotify, it's excellent for podcast. I really like this app.",positive
I love it app so nice songs ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°,positive

Easy to make a playlist of your favorite artists.,positive
"Lame and constraining like YouTube as of late, forcing one to listen to music, not allowing skipping through or directly choosing what to listen to half the time. Gives me the motivation to but CDs or mp3s again and build a collection.",negative
Excellent,positive
"Awesome I like this music app I really enjoy music in very high quality but some movies missing like rakshak, itihaas, mrityudaata, tere mere sapne, diljale etc",negative
The update earlier this year has stopped connecting to my car stereo Spotify app. This was the main reason I went with Spotify and the stereo. The unit is a pioneer MVH-X580DAB. I have since updated the firmware and it is not that. After doing some research it appears to be a common problem with different stereos. I don't just want to roll back my Spotify app. I would like it to be fixed. Or do I go back to amazon?,negative
Awesome application for listening songs. I just love it ðŸ”ðŸ’¯,positive
Almost all the basic features of a music player--as basic as selecting a specific song to listen to--are premium only. The desktop version is fine but the mobile version is useless because of this.,negative
Had a few issues but mostly enjoy it. Been using Spotify for year's and for me it's the best. Some song's are missing or can't be played but that's ok.,positive
It's the best thing to listen to when your alone,positive
This app is amazing â¤ï¸ i just love Spotify â¤ï¸,positive
Thank you so much for ur kindness atleast I can choose 4 or 5 songs I wanted,positive
"Love Spotify, unfortunately you almost have to buy the subscription so you're not bombarded with ads. I also don't like that for some reason all my saved (liked) songs and albums just disappear, it will only ever show me my most recent - not sure if ther is a limit, but either way it's annoying, especially that I pay $17 a month!",negative
I love the playlists and the wide variety of songs and podcasts,positive

Best app for music playlists!!!,positive
"I Can't see my downloaded audiobooks when I'm offline, I hate this new updateðŸ˜¤",negative

This is the best music player i've ever used.It has a good quality of playing music and you can have access to all kinds of music that you want.,positive
Best quality of audio but sometimes the ad will come in front of audio,negative
"It was good at first. But now I have to pay to shuffle through my favorite music. Whenever I want search up a song and click on it it plays a WHOLE other song, its very annoying. So many things wrong with spotify.ðŸ˜•",negative
4 30 second ads for skipping one song? My 5 star just went to 2.,negative
I am not a big fan of any advertising other than that I really enjoy the variety of artist and listening to my favorite songs of my past and present artists I was gifted an AQURBOOST BOOM speaker for Xmas which I use to accompany Spotify this 5 star app. Thank you and bless you.,positive
Excellent ðŸ‘Œ... Good for burning calories....,positive

Annoying that your music will sometimes just undownload if you have premium,negative
"After the latest update, my spotify keeps on crashing whenever i hit play. Tried uninstalling and installing it again its still the same. I have premium subscription. ðŸ™„ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜®â€ðŸ’¨",negative
"I'm putting my stars down to 3 for the moment so that I can report an issue. I'm trying to add music to my Playlist, but it no longer let's me preview a snippet from the tracks so I can't tell what the pieces sound like before I want to add them into my Playlists.",negative
"Ossm for music lovers,it's really good",positive
Spotify is a fantastic music app,positive
"Not sure whats going on. But since switching my phone to a newer device, when my screen locks, or goes black, the music starts to buffer. Like, the song would be playing, it would pause then play again then pause again 2 seconds later. I am finding no solution online. So I came here to see what could be going on and it seems alot of other people are having the same issue. The music will still play if the screen is on though.",negative
November 2021 update messed with the friend feed and STILL hasnt been fixed ffs,negative

Since few weeks crashing all the times. Looking for other app.,negative
The only bad part is the ads,negative
"Horribly buggy. Also, stop shoving podcasts down our throats! I pay for Spotify, I don't want to see more ads! Update: still buggy",negative
Sound stops every 5 min. Here 12. Of April the app sucks and not the money I for it.,negative
Sound Quality of some of the older songs are pretty bad. Perhaps because the original recordings were not that good,negative

Hate the ads but love the variety of music.,positive
"Same issues as everyone else with it randomly stopping or not showing controls and doesn't seem to work well with Android auto anymore and refuses to play music. Getting tired of it constantly breaking, do you do any testing at all?",negative

Very good for me. I love songs to hear and sing.,positive
"This is one of the best music apps ever. Thank you Spotify for allowing me to put all my music together in different groups. Although I am unable to afford the Premium, the free version of this app is just as good.",positive
I have a Samsung s10+ and Spotify previously worked fine. But recently the playbar has disappeared and songs are glitching or stop completely! Would not recommend.,negative
"Crashes all the time, shuffle sucks, too many stupid features/bugs, downloaded songs won't play in airplane mode",negative
I don't pay for music and the ads do not bother me. Seems to have a decent selection of music and well randomized for my taste. I especially like the daily lists that are automatically created for me.,negative
How can I preview songs to see if I will like them? I'm not gonna wait how many songs just to play one song if I don't even like it yet. Also I'm free plan user. Pls add back the preview.,negative

Good app but they should let us download songs for free and the ads are irritating me Spotify don't think me wrong stop ads !!!!!!!!!,negative

"Little bugs, easy to navigate interface, heavy selection of artists, Playlists are nice, this has become the golden standard of what a music platform has to offer.",positive
It's ok but it's getting expensive and it is literally useless if you do not have a high speed internet connection. It's better to put it on airplane mode than dare drop below perfect signal,negative
Very good app for music listeners,positive
Amazing I luv this app especially at the the end of the year they show ur stats for the year,positive
Spotify is awesome. I have found every song that I have looked up. And the download feature I great since I drive a lot for work and it can be hard or impossible to find good radio stations in some states along back roada.,positive
Everything is premiumi cant understand this app,positive
I love all of the options I have to listen to music on Spotify. Awesome!,positive
Love the music variety and app. Although buyer beware the download while on cellular data toggle is very buggy and while I had it set to off the app downloaded 7 GB worth of music to my phone before I got a notification from my carrier of high data usage. Never really been an issue until the last couple of updates but could cost someone alot of money luckily I have 8 GB worth of data or that could have cost me $700 (my carrier charges $10 per 100mb after limit). This needs to be fixed!,negative

So, if someone could help me out with that, that'd be cool.",negative
The best music streaming app on the planet,positive
This app is so bad. You only get 6 skips per hour but yet they add 10+ random songs to your playlist. You can't even put your song on repeat.,negative

Love the app and use it all the time!!!,positive
"Premium user. Love the app, but today for over five hours now, it's been telling me 'No internet connection,' which isn't true because every other mobile data-reliant app on my phone is working. I have switched off my phone, cleared cache, uninstalled the app, redownloaded. But now I can't even sign in because it keeps saying 'No Internet connection.' This sucks!",negative
"Good music app, gives you a lot of options for free",positive
I'm having the same problems other people seem to be having atm. The now playing feature is suddenly non existent so I can't skip through my playlist. It also won't turn off when I turn off my Bluetooth device. It just keeps playing through the phone so the only way i can stop the music is by uninstallling the app. I'm at the point of not really wanting to reinstall it because its so frustrating to use. I'm also getting 3 - 4 second pauses in the middle of songs.,negative
My everyday music app. Has a large database of songs compared to Prime Music.,positive
It won't let me play my own playlists and plays other songs suggested to me. The songs in my playlist only play for a few seconds.,negative
Nice and easy to use.,positive
"It would have been better if they were lyrics or like the iTunes,01/07/2022 thank you for the lyrics ðŸ¥°",negative
"I don't have any complaints over the app but, I've got a suggestion if you can consider. I was just thinking, if there would be an option to mute all notifications that could disturb the song. Like a slider near shuffle or repeat option so that the user can listen songs without disturbances. But keeping in mind the importance of the notifications in one's life, this option could be turned off manually or automatically when someone clears the RAM or closes the app.",negative
"Ok. I get it. You're bound to have ads if you don't subscribe to premium, but does it have to be 5-6 ads, and usually the same ads, between every song?! We're promised 30 minutes of ad free streaming and that should be consistent. Not just at the start of playing a Playlist and then the rest of the time it's ads and more ads.",positive
"Best premium streaming music app I've used, nice job spotify",positive
It amazing if it continues providing free music.At the moment I'm getting old music of my choice. Keep it up.,positive
I've been a premium subscriber for 10 years. I LOVE Spotify! I've never had a problem finding what I like to listen to. The app is easy to navigate and user friendly. They definitely have something for everyone. I am a happy Spotify customer!,positive
Best way to hear pure way of music and huge collection,positive

Spotify has become my sole music player app because of the playlists I have made.,positive
This app is really good if u have premium but if your not looking to pay its probally not the best because if u search a song u will have to wait for the 4th 1 to be yours but u only hqve 6 skips an hour,negative

every damn time I try to get my premium I get unable to connect error AFTER I finished loading the damn page. this doesn't happen when using normal browser. your app is trash yo.,negative
You broke it with the last update. GUI disappearing without reason. Rollback and try again,negative
Amazing music app with a massive flaw The 10 dollars for premium is worth it since you can download music for offline and stream without ads But it's impossible to customize the home screen. I'm stuck with podcasts that I never listen to taking up screen space instead of music,negative
I really enjoy keeping updated and listening to my music favorites with Spotify. It makes me happy and makes me feel relaxed! Thank you Spotify. Year later and enjoying Spotify so so much. I appreciate the variety of oldies that I am entertained with while driving!!! Thank you Spotify!!!,positive
"It is awesome, i have the free version. I don't mind the adds, I just don't like the fact that they are so loud. I find the right volume I want, and then bam an add, it is really frustrating.",negative
Smooth and clean what more to say,positive
Amazing there music is everything your want and it's no charge of pay ðŸ™‚,positive
Its good until it stops giving you the 30 minutes ad free,positive
Love this app but quality of each song can still be improved to HD. Some are not up to CD Quality,positive

I used to love this app and could deal with ads. But now with the update or whatever I can't listen to just one song no it has to be shuffled with songs I don't want to hear. And yesterday when I was trying to skip one song (I didn't use any of skips that hour) It wouldn't let me skip and kept saying I discovered a premium feature. I used to want to recommend it friends but I wouldn't recommend to anyone.,positive
Love the app just hate how you cant skip as many times as you want,positive
I personaly love using it because it has no complications and the sound is never distorted.,positive
I loved this app I can listen to every song I want to listen and they even have very nice playlist ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„,positive
Lovely music of my choosing. No hiccups enjoyable listening,positive
It is very good app. I like it very much. I give four stars for too many ads. So please solve this problem. And thank you for this app.,positive

"My preferred language for Music is Kannada, there is no playlist dedicated for Kannada instead there is dedicated playlist for all other languages such as Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and Marathi. I would rather stop using such Music apps. Shame on you",negative
"Mostly great, but if you must interrup make you commercials good. Not effin stupid and annoying.",positive
Best music platform. Very classic.,positive
Nice but please reduce some adds,positive
I just want to be able to delete some of the songs that use to listen to because the person who made that song did something absolutely terrible and I don't wanna be able to look at their songs and remember what they did ðŸ§ðŸ¾â€â™€ï¸,negative
"Ads. How many can a person bear at once ? One , two , what the hell is 3 ads all together ? Really Dissappointed with the ads cause not everyone is willing to buy the premium. Limit the ads that's a suggestion",negative

Good i love it i even love how u can hear music while playing (:,positive
App won't connect to the spotify in my vehicles radio now. It worked just fine a couple of weeks ago then all the sudden won't anymore. The phone connects but spotify does not. It plays though Bluetooth but not the spotify app. Has to be a update caused it. I have a pioneer avh-2500nex head unit.,negative
It's a good app. Although I logged out of my account so my friend could do something on her account cuz her phone died. But when I tried to log back in it said my account doesn't exist. I'm still logged into it on my Playstation and I'm putting in the exact info like username and everything on my phone but it still says it doesn't exist.,negative
"Spotify is okay (not great) for playing music, but it is the worst podcast platform. It's extremely irritating that there are now so many Spotify exclusive podcasts when they are so bad at streaming podcasts. It doesn't remember where I left off and randomly in the middle of a podcast it'll stop and start playing a different episode. As for music, Spotify seems to choose the cheapest option to play (weird covers or other languages) rather than the popular or desired version of a song.",negative
"What the hell?? You cant control the timestamp of the song, and if you want to play another song in your liked songs you cant play it, it only give you a short moment of the song and IT IS SO ANNOYING, YOU CANT EVEN PLAY AGAIN THE SONG WHEN YOU WANT, YOU CANT DRAG IT TO THE LEFT SIDE OH MY GODD",negative
"I would give this a 5 star but recently it's now just not working anymore, can no longer view podcasts or albums or even start playlists.",negative
I like the app cause it has the songs I like but there are way to many ads just the other day I was listening to music and it played two songs then played like 7 ads then at that point I just stopped playing the music and went to my other and better music app Treble Music.,negative
"Good. Just wish for some feature stability. For example, sliding to the right to add to queue, doesn't work in the Liked Songs listing or in the search results listing. Also, when searching for sth, it'd be great to have the liked and saved stuff show up first. But that's complaining on a very sensitive level. Great app overall",positive
Finally got tired of the constant email and spamming. You sign up for an app and all you get is constant harassment. No respect for their customers.,negative
1 star is more than you deserve,positive
My daily companion. I thought I knew music well but Spotify has opened my ears and eyes to a much richer world.,positive
I can't even play the music I want because it's playing something else I don't like!!! Fix it now!!,negative
App keeps crashing when I press play the play button after the new update. Will change my score once this is fixed. I've even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and it still doesn't fix the issue. Using a Vivo X70 Pro. *Updated review* Issue fixed,negative
Too many useless ads. Also crashes frequently.,negative
I signed up for 30 day trial and can't play my play list,negative
I enjoy Spotify and have been using it for quite a while. My only gripe with it is that when listing to an artists mix I wish they played more of the artist and less of the similar artists.,negative
If I can't change the theme of my lyrics at least give me nice themes because your current themes are very boring,negative
It will not let me choose the song I want to listen to otherwise it is a good app,positive
"All songs I could not find on other music apps were here, it was a very good music apps, easier to find songs you like and love to hear......",positive
im a premium user but these days the app stoped in the middle of playing music And then the played song bar disappear. The widget on home screen or menu bar also disappear. i need to restart my phone first to make it work again. Please fix this. it happens on both my android phones.,negative
It's good to listen to music,positive
Horrible. Why can't I play a Playlist in order without premium. What's the use of calling it a Playlist if its always on shuffle?,negative
"Fix the app, it still is janky at best, randomly starts playing music after being disconnected from Android auto and won't pause / stop without force stopping the app, this was never a problem before.",positive
Very good! I like to get to know new artists an music styles and the proposed themes help a lot!,positive
"Just another way to be spied on by people with ðŸ’© intentions- I miss the 80s You can laugh, but at least our every move isn't on candid camera, all our likes & dislikes are monitored.

One of the best useful app especially for motivating your self â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸,positive
LOVE MUSIC SO VERY MUCH. DIDN'T HEAR OF MUSIC.,positive
Good app for music streaming as to your required musicians,positive
"I am very mad about the new update, everytime i use a playlist after the first song is done it plays a song that not even in the playlist :[",negative
I love the variety of music and podcasts on here but this app on my android continually force closes without warning. Half the time the music bar with the play button doesnt appear and I can see / control what is playing beyond shuffle and I pay for premium. Very frustrating.,negative
After last update it don't work as it use to. All my downloaded podcasts disappear when im offline. ðŸ¤· whyyyy?! whats the point then?!,negative
This app worked for a while but then it deleted ALL of my liked songs and now NOTHING will work. It used to be so good and not it's HORRIBLE!!!!!!,negative
"Hi! I use Spotify from 2020, and im really excited about it! There's really user-friendly interface, so many songs and podcasts. I like thus app very much! When Spotify imposed sanctions, I was forced to switch to Yandex music. I don't like it like Spotify, BUT: there's a mix ""my wave"". It give you really great tracks. If you add something like this in Spotify, I will be very happy!!",positive
Best app for music full stop,positive
It's a great app for music and podcast lovers. The only glitch is that you cannot cancle your premium subscription from your phone account u need a desktop to do it. Rest all good.,positive
I love this app before I hated it because there was so much ads on it but when I decided to check it out again there was not ads that I could see so I love this app its probably the best app I ever used to whoever is reading this if you love music get this app it's the best .,positive
App consistently closes by itself just after opening it nearly every time for the last week. Please update,negative
"the new update is horrible. it changed the app completely. i cant see what the next song is, the queue is gone, i cant play just one song if i want to and it adds random songs i dont want in my playlists. i cant turn shuffle mode off and it constantly repeats certain songs. and on top of that it STILL tries to get me to buy premium. what is even the point of buying it anymore?? im seriously disappointed.",negative
"App keeps crashing, have tried all suggestions and fixes. Now it won't even load.",negative
Amazing,positive
I love Spotify. You can listen to any music(song) you want!!! I love it â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ðŸŽ¶âœ¨,positive
I love this app bt i have face a problem. I'm a premium user bt my download option is not properly work in my device.,negative
Getting really tired of all the issues. Have to reinstall to see what song is playing or edit playlists. Sometimes will only play one song then stops. Songs have been getting stuck/ skipping. Really not practical atthe minute. Used to be good though,negative
"Newest update constantly pauses anything I'm listening to, media bar gone so no control. App is barely usable",negative
Very good and nice app for music,positive
Lol music quality is good but the ads are just kinda annoying and when im sleeping and listening to Spotify the ads are just kinda really annoying in my phone theres no repeat for the song since i always like my music in repeat for other i dont know i guess they have the repeat button but i dont have the repeat song button so yeah i only hibe it 4 stars.,negative
Honestly with the choice of quality variety and access to podcasts and audible tracks as the home for my music I dont think you can do better right now Now if they added whole music videos theyd be my favorite even over MTV back in the day,positive
Spotify is very easy to use It's one of the best music apps out their if not best.,positive
The best,positive
Love the algorithm that streamlines similar songs to play,positive
lots of music aren't there.Eats up storage space like there's no tomorrow. and pointless without wi fi or internet. I'm looking forward to something better than this. Lately it randomly stops playing while I'm teaching a cardio fitness class and also looses the media control bar! :(,negative
"The more I use it, the worse it gets. It used to be ok, but now I'm forced to listen to 3 adds in a row every 2 songs I listen. and as if that wasn't enough, when we go to an artist account to listen to a specific album, we are forced to listen to every other track from every other album the artist has. this is really annoying, since Spotify is the only place i can listen to a new album when it is released, but because this happens, I can't even listen to the whole thing. please do better.",negative
"Its a beautiful app to listen song ad-free in spotify Premium. I discovered and it was amazing experience for a musicholic , who every night before sleeping listen songs without any ads",positive
"When ur playing music, typically the song shows up at the bottom of page on on the lock screen - this feature is malfunctioning and the current song playing is gone.",negative
Very bad because download song can't play after one week..,negative
Overall its great. But i think Friends Activity should also be a feature on the mobile version too. Not just the desktop ones.,positive
Sometimes the app just skips to the end of the podcast after an advisement. Now I have to scan through the podcast to find where Spotify decided I had to move on but fought back. If Joe Rogan wasn't on this app I would NEVER use it.,negative
"Spotify has been a great experience in the world of music for me !!! I love that in my wide range of loving & listening to music I can get any kind I want & any song & then listen to it without internet access !!!! Also make my favourite play list !!!! Highly recommend this app to any music lover , it's a must !!!!!!",positive

"I love Spotify, I really enjoy being my own DJ!!! More Nova Rockafella though, Mi Yard!!!!!",positive
Love it! I have premium and in my opinion it's better than any other app I used.. I would recommend!! Thanks spotify for making my day!,positive
"One less star just for the lack of a clear queue button in the app.. I keep getting the same darn podcast that auto plays.. Glitch city. What is the point of downloading songs or episodes when the app just streams anyway. If I have a connection to the internet, the podcast I'm listening to keeps buffering. If I disconnect, then it runs fine. So glitchy",negative
"I'm realizing only the best songs from some albums are unavailable. Is that because spotify can't afford the good stuff? There is a song grayed out in an album. If I google why the song won't play, I get all spotify web pages telling me I can listen right now. But cannot. It is available on other apps, in fact I just found out spotify is the only one with all these particular songs missing. The reason being that in some countries they don't allow certain content. What a sham.",negative
I love this app. i can listen to whatever kind of music i want and i love that kind of freedom.,positive
It's a really good app to use while sleeping or when ur doing work but there are just UNLIMITED amount of ads. Like 1 song plays then there will be like 3 ads and that's just ruins the fun. Overall it's the best app to listen music!,negative
"Ok its a good app and all but THE ADDS man i cant get a good 20 mins qithout 11 adds in a row, i counted and there was 11 adds in a row today, I cant even handle it.",negative
"It's the worst app I've ever used, especially the PC. Please stop cause you're corrupt",negative
'Money' by LISA is replaced by a unauthorized song in Today's Top Hit playlist. This is happening in many other playlists too. LISA fanbase are trying to reach spotify service but no one is answering. Because of this issue 'Money' dropped from global 200 today. It is affecting the streaming number of the song too. Please fix this issue,negative
"Generally nice - but integrations buggy, offline mode USELESS, and moving storage failed and deleted everything. Ignores metered setting for WiFi which is a big pain! Fix this stuff and it'd be amazing as the ideas are great. Would be nice to be able to tune the suggestions algorithm as it either sticks to what you know or picks tracks it should know I don't like.",negative
To many advertisements are there,negative
"The performance of the app is by far the worst experience I've had on all of its platforms. It doesn't work well on Android, neither on iPhone nor on PC. It's amazing that being multi-million dollar developers can't fix performance on all devices. I don't know a single person who thinks Spotify works great, we all have the same bad experience and you don't do anything about it. The music? excellent but you don't do it, you just put it on stream app that being your only task, you fail. 1/5 for me",negative
"Control bar keep disappearing, music keeps stopping. What's wrong ðŸ˜• ðŸ˜ž",negative
"this is the best app to listen to music, when i feel like listening to BTS i can they give you 30 minutes off of adds if you watch an add",positive

"Spotify stream good less data consumption fast and good taping ,one thing i dont like is the volume my devices it dosnt boost sounds good the way i want pls let the developer of this App still work on the sounf production thanks",positive
"In the last few weeks the app has been unstable with the control banner at the bottom of the screen disappearing, with no way to control the music other then to select a new song or playlist. Constantly having to un/reinstall the app multiple times a day just for it to work for 2-3 songs before the same issue. You can tell when the apps breaks as the control from the lock screen and the swipe down control disappear too (android user). Have updated my phone os and still facing issues.",negative
"Ok so why I rate this app one, is because when I tried to play my fav song, and then the song started to play other song and I tried to play another song ITS STILL PLAYING OTHER SONG PLS FIX IT",negative
Very inspirational and overall amazing.,positive
Songs keep stopping and starting lately. Driving me nuts. Maybe time to try something else more reliable.,negative
I loved this app......... until the app added songs to your playlist.Like... I made a playlist because that's what I like to listen to. STOP RUINING GOOD APPS FOR ME!!!!!,negative
"Great, but can't skip when I wanna ðŸ˜Ÿ",positive
very good but Spotify has a better songs,positive
"As a casual user, the annoying ads at double the current playing volume are a deal breaker. Ads fine, but I don't see why they have to be so much louder than the music your listening to. I don't use it enough to pay for this as a service, so will uninstall.",negative
"Lags randomly, can't pick the song I want to listen to because of it. Offline doesn't work with songs I've downloaded and I've put up with it for months because I'm subscribed and there is no good platform out there.",negative
"Love this music app always, wouldn't use anything else for music, as I can post music I love on social media so others can listen. I wish I can find the older older albums on spotify that artists have made long ago.",negative
Ahhhh this app randomly crashes and then it will not be useful to play any type of songs ...........it's very irritating,negative
I like Spotify because there is nothing wrong with it,positive
It's a good app it has a lot of songs that I love.... but it doesn't let me see the song playing and it makes it really hard to pause the song or go to a different song.,negative
I have had a Spotify Premium account for the past three years and I've enjoyed the experience. So much so that I upgraded to a Family account but now the other members that I added on the plan do not have the lyrics feature but I do. This doesn't make sense.,negative
"Be using for years, always super easy to navigate and organize playlists. Highly recommend, use mostly because I can organize my specific music taste unlike other music players.",positive
I like their music variety and what I'm looking for I can find it. Is just great,positive
"In general the app is good, but recently when I play music it will occasionally not show the notification to show what song is playing or the app will freeze, I also can't unhide songs. Please fix these issues.",negative

"Dear developer, App is nice.But it is not at all opening sometimes.",negative
"Hey, can you give us an option to just randomly play a song, either from any of the playlists or from your suggestions for me or any random song and not just the last played song, from the home page upon app load? More like the Surprise me option in Netflix?",negative
Whenever I randomly open the app (randomly) it just keeps stopping and I don't know why tap on a podcast another song starts playing.... It's not that my phone lags or something else but no my phone is brand new and about about my connection then I really have a very strong connection.... I uninstalled and reinstalled it but still same problem. It was making me sick.... I really hope that the developers see this issue and fix it..,negative
Blend wins all the stars. I'd give one extra if I could.,positive
"I need to download songs to listen in offline, but there is no option to download songs.",negative
Back to back to back to back to back 30 second advertisements even after it said next 30 mins without ads. Have to reset app just to hear music..,negative
"I downloaded Spotify specifically to listen to the ""Science VS"" podcast. Due to spotify's stance that it is taking with Joe Rogan and the spreading of misinformation, I am now removing the app for my phone.",negative
"This is my favorite streaming service and love listening to Joe Rogan. They made the right decision in keeping him. I don't always agree with the individuals he interviews but that is ok, I don't have to. It's nice to be exposed to the different view points that are offered.",positive
"Usually this is my go to for music. Went to play some today and there are no controls. I can't skip, play, fast forward nothing! And the sound is very off. What's going on?",negative
A nice app but still some network issues. Please fix it in next update and I will rate it 5 stars,positive
This app is good for hearing BTS songs ðŸ˜‚,positive
The best music streaming platform it can't be beat,positive
"App stuck on load screen, even after multiple uninstalls.",negative
They should let us skip more then 6 songs rather then having us pay for premium to be able to. I however like the collection and the lyrics addition.,negative
All bugs and errors fixed at last. Spotify is again back as best streaming platform for music and podcasts.,positive
My problem has been solved. Thank You spotify India. I love it.,positive
Hate the new update to playlists. Scroll bar not working anymore ever since last update. Used to be able to hold the scroll bar and quickly find songs through out my playlists. Now I have to manually scroll past my thousands of songs. Will uninstall,negative
You search for a song and it plays another one... How annoying ... Uninstall the garbage,negative
I love this app but there's ONE problem. Ads. Everytime I try to relax and listen to music an ad comes up and it's annoying.,negative
Love this app so much. Have been using it a lot more since December as I got 6 months free Spotify Premium as a benefit when I got my Samsung phone in October. Will be continuing with premium (but paid of course) once the 6 months free of charge Premium ends. So happy that local files option is now on Android phones aswell as on desktop version. Keep up the amazing experience. Thank you Spotify ðŸ‘Œ,positive
"For more than a week now i an unable tobdownload Spotify app on my Samsung A51. I have been in touch with the technical department and have done all the measures one can perform to fix the issue like deleting data n cache, clearing up storage and memory uninstall and reinstall thousands of time. Spotify could not rectify the issue at all and then wanted me to participate in their service suvey.....rubbing salt over wounds...Its not free, i am paying for their service...feel cheated by spotify",negative
I've loved using Spotify with the recent update it plays through my phone as well as my Bluetooth in my car this needs to be fixed it's driving me crazy I would've given five stars if it worked like it used to,negative
"Dude I've been on Spotify for God knows how many years, y'all have done me a lot of good, but the 5 ads between every single song is ridiculous. I'm seriously considering deleting it. Not to mention you also do not pay the artists for the money you make off their songs, which is against copyright laws. Honestly I may just delete",negative
"One of my best app! Spotify= LoveðŸ’“ This app has all types of songs, like anime, jpop which I'm so interested in. Even though I didn't have a premium subscription, ads became a part of journey and I even sing those ads sometimes too! I use Spotify more than any other app on my device. Thanks for making a great app!ðŸ’“",positive
Good range of music,positive
"Great app. My music taste improved a lot from it, thanks to the Playlists I found (made by other users) I was able to find new and underrated songs I really liked. I use to not like to listen to music much because everything I found sounded very generic to me but thanks to this app I was able to lengthen my knowledge on different songs and genres and overall live a better emo life.",positive
Can't play any songs it always says you're offline even when I have high speed wifi and network it is become a worst music app available in play Store,negative

Every time i wanna play a song. It plays the wrong song that i dont like. Please fix this,negative
"The reason why i gave it 1 star is because i cant click on any songs to preview what its like on the add songs. If this is a bug, please fix it i cant find any such direct tutorial to fix this bug/problem. Or its just apart of your new update. Which i dont like (This is not hate towards the app this is just my reason and explination why i have it a 1 star, and the problem im experiencing)",negative
How can you guys okay with your app..I can neither log into nor make a new account...how inappropriate. I've been trying from so long but it all gone waste.

Its a great app for music and in my opinion the best,positive
My free trial was coming to an end and was going to cancel but the fact that you stood with rogan persuaded me to keep the service ðŸ‘,positive
I have to forcibly kill the app before I use the app. Your app is turning into garbage. I can't believe I'm paying for a premium account. Oh and nothing is more annoying that placing ads in the middle of a podcast! First placed ad and I stop listening to the podcast.,negative
The best app in music but you should add sapne sajn ke too,positive
"For a paid app, and also such a big company, has a ton of issues, especially when trying to use when you do not have service. Selection is excellent.",positive
I downloaded Spotify for music not Podcasts. Disappointed that I'm losing favourite artists because of Joe Rogans BS. Time to try out TIDAL,negative
"I am a premium member, for almost a year.I have downloaded playlists and created albums but for the past few months when wanting to play an album it just starts twirling again then I have to stop and manually download everything again which is kinda annoying when in the car wanting to play something and then the downloads are no longer downloaded. I regularly clean the cache and have had to uninstall and re-install often just to have to download everything again. Going 2 try the Lite version now",negative
Spotify is too limited in their plans. I wanted to get a duo plan for my granddaughters but can't. Is have to buy gift cards and pay for 2 full memberships. Not cool.,negative
"Had a premium subscription and worked flawlessly for a long time. Over last couple of months however will randomly lose internet connection, even with all other apps working on my phone. Support unable to find a fix and to be honest have been extremely basic in their approach. Unfortunate timing for Spotify to ask for a rating!",negative
IM ONLY GIVING 5 STARS FOR JOE ROGAN DONT YOU GUYS DARE REMOVE HIM FOR SPREADING THE TRUTH! Thanks again for showing his podcasts to us. If you kick him out I'm off too like many others. Don't be spoil sports yeah. Thanks,positive

I love the variety and suggestions Playlist created for me.,positive
"My app has crashed consistantly every single day, for 2 and half months. I've had premium for longer than that. Why is it happening? Why is it happening every single day? UPDATE: SPOTIFY has decided to remove the capability to shuffle and repeat if you don't have premium, even for songs downloaded on my phone, from sources that are not Spotify. So now your desperate enough for money that you remove BASIC FUNCTIONS from your music player? Why would I want to use a half working app? Disgusting",negative
"Great app and really enjoy the music and building special playlists to enjoy. But word of advice for Spotify owners, stay neutral from politics. These are ugly times. Folks just want to listen to music or podcasts. If they don't like what they hear they simply can turn the channel to something they do like. Do not cave to a small percentage of those who think their policies and opinion should be the opinion of the whole. Freedom is what endures forever. That, and keeping the price low too ;)",negative
Is a really good app,positive
It gives Quality Music but why 3 ads after every 3-4 songs!!,negative

Literally doesn't work anymore. New update didn't fix it. No Playlists and can't listen to anything. Unacceptable,negative
brilliant as always,positive
I'm either listening to a podcast or music after maybe 2 minutes into it pauses and I have to keep pressing play for it to start,negative
Would be 5 stars except for the new update that makes it always want to connect to Bluetooth which may have resulted in the fact it no longer works as perfectly (e.g. it randomly stops playing),negative
Too many adds. Constant issues with skipping to next song. Practically useless.,negative
"Love the app, only having issues with the new update, whenever I play a song there's no option to see the queue anymore . Otherwise love all the music and functions",negative
What have you become Spotify! So great your app used to be! Please optimise and improve your app and other stuff in the app! 3 back to back ads coming after each song played! Watch 30 seconds video to listen ad free for 30 minutes doesn't work! Why are you so hell bent on pushing users to buy Spotify premium! Absolutely spoils the experience! Please sort this stuff! Super annoying experience! Uninstalling the Spotify app!,negative
"I absolutely love spotify. I have been with them for years, and out of all the entertainment apps out there, Spotify by far is the best.",positive
This app is amazing and it's sound quality just wow,positive
"The music is lovely i enjoy it it helps me with stress and to get outta my comfort zone , honestly it would've been a five solid ,however that changed as of yesterday , yesterday Spotify worked perfectly no issues and now I cant log into my account i used the same email that this is under but it still didn't work and i really am upset about it and have been trying to fix it but nothing is working.",negative
I've had Spotify since college and the update is nice,positive
"Spitify is the onlynapp which accompany me whereever I go, what ever my activities..",negative
I love this music app its so cool I have been with us for years an absolutely love it no problems,positive
Swipe right to add to queue feature is missing -> 2 stars. I will update to 5 stars after getting the same feature as in iOS. Edit: One year later - Thanks for adding the feature. Enjoy 5 star rating â¤ï¸,negative
"Can updates not change the storage space back to internal storage instead of SD card please. + the app ""isn't responding"" everytime I try to open it now. Great update.",negative
Im a premium user of this.. but now after an update i cant play music it ap crashes when i play any music,negative
What's going on with this latest update? Literally unusable. Stops playing after 10 mins and when it does it doesn't display any currently listening info. I pay for this...,negative
"App is a mess, playback wont continue anymore. Sick to death of this ""premium"" service that constantly cuts in and out. Sick of posting help post in community. Going back to pirating.",negative
This was an amazing app although I would appreciate it if you would PUT LESS FUCCIN ADS,positive
"Pretty good,the only thing that just has to go is, spotify let people download songs themselves stop putting random songs in a playlist i cant enjoy music and it messes up the whole playlist and experience And i cant delete the songs out of it.",negative
Everything is fine except why on Earth do I have to listen to four consecutive ads,positive
"Hi, I've been trying to subscribe for premium now for a while, each time i keep getting payment failed. There's nothing wrong with my card cause I've used it on both yt music and tidal.",positive
Plays and stops by it self. Settings do not work,negative
I like it. Plan and simple,positive
"I get to hear two songs, and then get 3 ads in a row, then I might be able to listen to 5 songs, but then get 4 ads in a row. When I first started using this app, I thought it was okay, but now all I seem to hear are ads, and suggested songs that I didn't add to any of my playlists. And why are they trying to get me to listen to country? I'm not a fan of that genre, but when I click the minus botton it plays 3 ads in a row. I know I'm one person, but this is really frustrating.",negative
The app is good and has thousands of songs to choose from including podcasts and other types of audio experiences. The 14 day free trial was nice as the standard premium is only $9.99 making it pretty cheap for the average user.,negative
I thought my old phone was the issue but I have a brand new phone and the same issies persist. Music and podcast stop mid stream or controls suddenly become unavailable. The only way to fix it is to restart the phone.,negative
Sound quality is very good ðŸ™‚ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,positive
THIS IS THE BESTT AHHHH!!!ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜IT HAS THE BEST SONGS plus you don't need to download a music downloader,positive
Wow,positive
I am giving 4 star because it's too expensive for me to do the monthly subscription. I would love more flexible lower prices. I love the richness and usability of the app. Thanks,positive
Just the most amazing musical experience in and beyond the multiverse! In a nano second of time you create what used to take me months and months and months to do. God! I wish I had this tech 25 years ago! Spot-on Spotify Spot-on.,positive
Are you going to increase profit.... Startung time its become good.. now its too waste ... Soo better to improve more features to user friendlyy,negative
"Spotify has been playing up the last few days, someone fix it please! The play screen doesn't appear so when you play a song, you can't see what's playing, and you can't stop what's playing because there are know play/pause controls",negative
Ends podcast playing at random times. So annoying to try and return to where I was on the podcast because it says I completed it and not even be halfway through.,negative
"The songs of this App, I have no opinion because it is very good! But my opinion here is in terms of advertising of the App, listening to music is less advertising, more advertising. After listening for less than 30 minutes, there are ads, but not 1 but 3 ads at a time. In the ad it says will be listening to music continuously for the next 30 minutes? Just listened to about 3 songs before the ad continues. Why is that?",negative
I'm giving it 1 star because for some reason the newer updates have made it so that my podcasts in my 'your episodes' section do not automatically play the next podcast. I like to listen to podcasts to sleep so it's annoying when one podcast finishes it doesn't play the next one meaning I have to look at my phone. Please make podcasts automatically play from the selected one like this app used to!,negative
Loved the app. Probably the best music provider out there. Reduced to 3 too many ads. Way too many.,negative
Was going fine with the app for a couple of days then all of a sudden it refused to let me in I can't listen to any of the songs on my playlist without glitching I'm very close to deleting this app ðŸ¤¬,negative
"I love Spotify however some of the safety features can be annoying such as if I'm a passenger in a vehicle but my Spotify is connected to the car I can't watch the video attached to the podcast I'm watching. Also, I occasionally have connectivity issues. Otherwise it's great.",positive
Latest update causes issue where play / pause on the bottom disappears. Music will stop playing randomly and only way to play again is to close and reopen the app,negative
very nice i got this app. i can get all my music from it and turn of my phone and liten.,positive
"Subscribed to Tidal instead, so my money can't be used by Spotify to pay podcasters to spread misinformation.",negative
One day I was able to switch between songs and fast forward or go back a song but now I cant anymore. It's always telling me to buy premium. And I HATE when songs that are recommending are put on my playlist and I cannot fast forward past them. I shouldn't have to pay for wanting to listen to music.,negative
To many advertisements,negative
Great first time experience. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes having his favorite music playing all the time.,positive
Made watch a 30-second ad then proceeded to tell me to stop skipping when it played recommended songs before the songs on my playlist. would not play the songs I put on my playlist. This app sucks,negative
Love it! Still in early stages but easy to use!!,positive
Nice ,positive
"Recent update destroyed all smooth functionality. Doesn't show what is currently playing, continues playing when disconnected from speaker etc.",negative
Pretty much unusable in mobile unless you listen to podcasts or buy premium,negative
"Songs stop playing randomly, have to restart albums all the time please fix",negative
This is my go to music app keep up the good work Spotify,positive
It's too easy to use app. I'm obsessed.....,negative
"Awesome ðŸ‘, all ways improving. Just make sure you look after the artist's that give us the good sounds.",positive
Worse..freaking.just to play mine playlist..its tooms hours to find and once it does than.. its only for.5 second and other.songs starts to.play that wasnt on the list and they gets full songs...i.dont understand music app playlist thats like a head and face ..so why ..another thing is it never.stops..always on.background. I am seriously like. Really amazed and.confused how this app became so popular....weird,negative
Their is no option for downloading songs . That means we couldn't here a song offline,negative
It was great until the last two or three updates from there on it crashes more often that it works...,negative
App keeps opening by itself,positive
"Love Spotify, it has some really great music.",positive
Great music app. Everything was cool until last update. Now my playlists are being interrupted by recommended songs. When l contacted support they immediately responded and their looking into the problem. Edit: Problem solved.,negative
you cant go some where and listen to music without internet.,negative
I love Spotify it have all the music ðŸŽ¶I love an listen to and more I recommend Spotify.,positive
Music is life. Love the selection of playlists. I'm updating my review. The pause button keeps disappearing then I have to uninstall the app to stop the music. Come on Spotify sort it out,negative
Newest update is terrible. Can't view what songs I'm currently playing. Can't use hands free to skip. Can't use android auto to control anything.,negative
very good app for listening to music,positive
Crashes all the time. Having to keep on closing and opening.,negative
"A library that doesn't have categories, so I have to search for everything. Ad's in Podcasts from Spotify for paying customers, despite a no ads promise.",negative
"music quality is good, but on mobile there are just too many ads to the point where it forces you to buy premium. i remember before there was only like 1 ad every 2-3 songs, but ive had instances where ive gotten 15 ads in a row after one song and then another 15 right after its not even funny. this also happens before playing any song on mobile.",negative
Good but Please reduce the advertisement,negative
"I would rate it a 5 star if you fix this bug. So lately ever since I wanted to listen to some music, it plays random music I don't want to listen to! It won't let me listen to the songs I select. If this keeps going on, I'm forever giving a 1 star!",negative
Its a nice music app but when I play a song like beliver it plays a suggested song and it says playing. Please fix this and this would be my favorite music app. I would give 5 stars.,positive
Malfunctions all the time. 1) have to force stop all the time since pause button disappears 2) sometimes just stops altogether 3) sometimes stops mid podcast and starts an entirely different one Awesome stuff. Fix it maybe?,positive
"Switched from Amazon Music to Spotify, so far I only see improvements, no unnecessary extra subscriptions to listen to my favourite songs. I'll definitely be sticking with Spotify for the foreseeable future. ðŸ˜",positive
Love this app especially the DJ station ,positive
It was going great till few weeks ago when my likes of songs only give me a preview of it and they added songs to playlist that I dont want,positive
App is not working from past 2 days. When I play a song app gets closed automatically. I uninstalled the app and installed it again like 3 times. Please fix the app.,negative
"It's a good app, I do have tonuninstall and reinstall it occasionally because it starts to shut off after 10-20 minutes",negative
Very good music app,positive
I bought premium for a reason to download songs and not listen to ads thankfully the ads are gone but when I download a playlist its downloaded but when I spend some time off the app then open it again random songs are just not downloaded anymore.,negative
Phenomenal,positive
"Tons of great music for everyone. This App is very user friendly. I highly recommend Spotify to everyone. Spotify is the #1 music app out there. If you don't have it, get it! Well worth it.",positive
Great I can listen to any artist I like,positive
Very very interesting app... And a variety of songs like dusk from Tobu and spectre from Alan Walker... I love this app!!! And congratulations for the owner of the app... Well done,positive
Lost my app when I change email can recover,negative
Love using Spotify premium. Has ever song I've looked for and it's really seamless and easy to use. Have been using Spotify every day for the past few years and don't plan on stopping.,positive
"5 stars... But, only if you download all your songs. If mobile data goes down so does Spotify. Nobody but me seems to have this problem that I've heard. Im not tech savvy... maybe I'm missing something.",negative
"The app is great. You don't have to pay premium to turn your phone off while music is playing and it continues when you leave the app. You can't play the music in a specific order, but I like it better that way (in my opinion). And ads aren't after every song like YouTube music. There's also the occasional 30 minutes without ads from sponsors or something which is a bonus. The only downside I'm having is the glitch it has with my phone for some reason, but it doesn't effect anything major.",negative
"App runs horrible on my S21 Ultra. I've already uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times. Honestly hot it because of the 9.99 for 3 months deal, but I don't think I'll be using after this. Constantly passes my podcasts for no reason, so I have to keep going back into the app to resume. I'm a truck driver so this is very annoying, seeing that this is one of my only sources of entertainment for most of the day.",negative
Never a problem works well and has the features I want Thanks Spotify,positive
Picking my playlists and creating them is easy and comfy,positive
Such a great app for music and podcast listening. Definitely recommend.,positive
This app is too good and just in the basic version soooo many features.,positive
Essential app but it used to be better and has a lot of ads.,negative
This app is Trash because it won't let us skips the ads THE ADS ARE ANNOYING and we can't choose the song we wanted! I arrange my playlist!! And I thought it would play the way youtube playlist did BUT NO. And people don't have a lot of money to buy premium! We are not that rich like you. (This is really gettin' on my nerves),negative
"Its easy to make a playlist out of my favorite music. Love how other playlist also pile up my favorites so its easy to like other people's compilation. It's really interesting to find them here. Also, I have fun with the yearend reports of my most listened to music, fave artists, etc. Kudos to spotify and artists!",positive
"People, just use Spotify Premium if you have so much problem with ads.",negative
App stops every 5mins. Been doing this a while. Gonna cancel subscription if its not resolved quickly. 11/12. Still does the same thing. $10.isnt much but Spotify expects its full amount I expect the app to work fully. 2/19. Still stops constantly. Do not pay for it. Absolute garbage.,negative
As good as any other music app Ive tried,positive
"Before when I wpuld create a playlist spotify would have 'recommended' songs that I had the option to add to the playlist. Now they automatically add them songs and no matter how many times I delete those songs, they just keep adding new ones. I used to like using spotify but now its just a pain in the a$$ with this new update. If I wanted those songs in my olaylist I would've added them myself.",negative
Can't play my favourites playlist on my Sonos set up! Seems like an on going problem for years now. Google it and tried all recommendations.,negative
"Wonderful app,it gives me comfort and keep my soul in the mood I choose as far as music is concern,I never get tired of using this apps.",positive
Not very Old Man friendly. Simple Technology know how is not easy for a lot of men born prior to 65.,negative
Best music app I really enjoy it when I'm depressed or happy .ðŸ˜… Anything anytime just spotify â£ï¸ Music is the medicine for everything ðŸ’•ðŸ’ž,positive
"great app, needs an update tho it completely takes off what I'm listening to, and kicks me off at times",negative
It's helpful for me when I want to listen to music ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽµ ðŸ˜Œand for some reason it's not on my screen so I always have to go to play store then go to spotify.,negative
"My original issue has changed to a new one; now there is no play, rev, ff buttons. It mostly plays without randomling turning off, but I have to close the whole app to turn it off and cannot go back or skip ahead. Sometimes it will show those buttons but tell me nothing is playing (when something is playing) so those buttons are useless.",negative
"This is probably the best music app you can get and I strongly recommend it. The app has very good customer service and the subscriptions are cheap and well made. The music selection is really good too. If I had to rate this app I'd say one out of ten is... Ease of usage 7-8 Customer service 8-8.5 Music/podcast selection 7.5-8.5 Sound quality 8.5-9.5 So over all 8.3 out of 10 but that's still really really good ""compared to the 6-7 Pandora got """,positive
It's really good but I wish u had given proper lyrics too but it's awesome app,positive
playback keeps stopping continually. tried restarting the phone and uninstall app. keeps happening.,negative
"Fast, reliable, and great channels!! Definitely my go to app for streaming music on drives!",positive
Overall it's a good app but the new update doesn't let you skip parts of the songs wich would be fine but i sometimes want to backtrack on songs that i have played before and when you play playlist it goes back to the song you were at and it also goes back on the same timestamp wich sucks when playing a different playlist and then returning to the other one and one last thing you can't start on wich song you want on your liked playlist. Fix these problems,negative
There is very good musics and we learn also lyrics.And i feel so Peace.And there is good song for broken hearted,positive
Everything's great and a premium Spotify user for a long time but recent updates got this thing where offline playing is not working. After 2-3 days of putting it on offline mode all downloaded songs are unplayable. This sucks since my nature of work is going to different places/countries for days maybe weeks and without internet. Spotify is my #1 go to app when I'm relaxing. Please fix this,negative
"I love Spotify, especially when I have premium",positive
It randomly will play the podcast without the bar used to pause or skip so I am forced to close the app. It constantly pushes my phone's connection to my PC even though I haven't connected the device (device not even avalible when I am on PC) but yet the podcast I was last litening to gets loaded and I loose what ever music I was listening to on my PC. Don't even get me started on all the issue with Google maps app integration which makes for unsafe driving! Please contact me for more info!,negative
"App is extremely buggy. Player controls disappear, can't select songs to play, and random drop outs during songs. Have to use other music streaming instead.",negative
Confused Whenever I'm playing music keep stopping at intervals which is annoying for a premium user. I have updated my app severally to know if it'd stop but nothing. I might have to switch to apple music if it continues this month,negative
"A piece of garbage, imagine not being able to view songs in an album, sucks in all ways.",negative
I love the lack of commercials and the fact that I an play things up to 3.5x speed.,negative
"I like how it gives you options on gapless playback, the recommendations are usually great but sometimes mediocre. Overall a great app.",negative
Spotify worked perfectly up until recently. Songs cut out randomly and I can't see the playbar. Extreamely frustrating,negative
It's an amazing song player like it moves smoothly between each song and has a variety of music for anyone!,positive
Its the problem with login. I have an account logged in with my number and damn..after the recent update it sucks. I have been using spotify and its the best so as far concerned..the ads are too many.. please fix any problem with bugs and the system...and please look into the problem where i cant even get log in,negative
Very good,positive
"Terrible android performance lately. Loss of audio, playbar constantly disappearing. Constant Bluetooth issues. Please fix this.",negative
Please add option to remove recently played,negative
I like the improved UI of application  kudos to the team,positive
"I just changed my phone from Redmi Note 8 Pro to ROG Phone 2 and I find out the equalizer is not available in my new phone. At first I thought maybe it's because I'm using an old version of Spotify - but even after the update, the equalizer is still not showing. How come????",negative
Its good but you can't have more than one person on the acc at a time,positive
"Can't pause or advance music on app.â€œNow Playing"" and the control buttons disappear most of the time. I've been using Spotify for years but this issue makes it frustrating to use and ruins the experience.",negative
Great music,positive

Great aap so good there r so many of songs and playlists for everything,positive
Great content but adds are becoming annoying and app is very unstable and crashes constantly.....,negative
I HATE the new update i can't listen to my playlist from the start and i have to hear songs i don't wanna listen now and ads!?! There weren't ads when i used it. No it's not easy to use anymore bc of the new stupid update,negative
I love how this works. It's smooth and I know I can count on it even when I'm off line. !,positive
Just brilliant,positive
The last update of Spotify is totally sucks. I can't played all my favorites music anymore if im offline and all my downloaded playlist is totally gone. What happened Spotify fixed all the bug and changes and all the mess you done. And its restricted the plan even you pay premium. Please back the old update. I loved the application but this is very disappointed and frustrating. Im using Spotify from the start and paying premium every monthly.,negative
You can only listen on shuffle like...why?? I really do miss the old spotifyT-T,negative
Just updated app and it SUCKS! Play controller disappears and I have to relaunch app several times to get it to work. Please fix app or I will remove and cancel my long standing subscription.,negative
"Support of racism has turned me off.. Been paying to support racism has made me a hypocrite. Going to cancel my subscription. Plus.. Lyrics option doesnt work.. Losing songs i like, and my daily playlist os jut my faves reordered Lyrics doesnt WORK. Nothing new.",negative
Spotify sucks. The only reason why i listen to spotify is because it has my favourite songs. Althought its insanely has way to much ads. And it sucks how you have to wait an hour to get skips so you have to wait hours just to skip the songs you dont like wich is annoying. That you have to listen to a bunch of other songs before you can listen to the actual song you want to play. It wastes so much time. And it crashes whenever i use spotify. If this was fixed ill rate more stars.,negative
"Glitches CONSTANTLY, pauses ALL THE TIME. Def don't pay for a paid membership. What a joke. Worst money I've spent this year. Fix your app Spotify. If I could give you 0 stars I would.",negative
"Awful recently, not sure what has happened but in the last 7 days the number of times streaming pauses has become impossible and difficult to use the app. Restarted, cache cleaned, phone upgraded, nothing help",negative
Probably the most frustrating app in the store. Crashes often. Many features just don't work. (like add to queue doesn't even work) I'm a paid subscriber and quite disappointed.,negative
"Good app for music, too many ads though",negative
Love the podcast. Dateline is my favorite. Even though this app has much more to offer than podcast. It's great! Ty,positive
It boggles my mind a software as large and prominent as Spotify cannot for the life of them figure out how to properly shuffle songs. They're lucky they have a monopoly on streaming services but once Google Play improves I'm out. How can something be considered shuffled when very regularly I hit back to back tracks from the same album/artist regularly. Or a cluster of songs get shuffled together and the only time you hear that song in shuffle is when it's in very close proximity to a set list,negative
Best app to explore your favorite songs.,positive
"Love Love Love Spotify! The best music app for artists you love and artists you haven't heard yet, but will also love! Great deal for students also but the price isn't bad regularly which includes Hulu and Showtime!",positive
"If the free version is constantly crashing, why the hell would I ever pay for premium service?!? Don't believe me, do a Google search for ""spotify keeps crashing"" and see the results. It will play 1 or 2 songs then stop. I tried clearing the cache, uninstalling/ reinstalling, adjusted the data mode, signed in/ out all with no change. Great catalog of music, but can't listen to it without regularly restarting my playlist every 5 -15 minutes. Please fix!!!",negative
I don't like how it adds songs into my playlist that I didn't add. But other than that it's good.,positive
It's a great app at least I get to listen to music I like whenever I like ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,positive

"Was working fine with no problems until last update, connects to Bluetooth through my car and it shows that the song is playing but no sound. I've done all the troubleshooting as this problem has seemed to occur in past updates but no luck. Pretty much only listen to Spotify in the car so definitely not worth my monthly premium subscription. Disappointing.",negative

Good app for any form of music,positive
"1 star if you dont pay for spotify premium, but 5 stars if you do. I really reccomend premium as it unlocks loads of more options. 100 percent worth the money for premium, also you can get family plans as well as premium duo which is just a version fof the family plan but just 2 people.",positive

Can't go back to a previous song. Can't listen to a specific song. Can't listen to a playlist in order. Keeps adding songs to my playlists without permission.

"Was an ok service, but I don't like how each time you log in then shut it down for the day it uses storage rom. After a few days, you look at your storage and it's hogging almost 2-3 gbs.

"It is impossible to shuffle play all downloaded tracks. People have been asking for this simple, highly useful feature for years. Before that it was actually possible.

Listening to my favorite artists and letting me branch out to find music everyday is the best experience. Always something new and I'm here for it,positive
"What to say means, the best app for relaxing mind and enjoying all types music and other stuff. Love this app.",positive
Best App I can even use hassle free I really recommend to use this app really so much people now you may not know me but trust that it's simpler than anything in the world (John Wayne) also said that about John F Kennedy.ðŸ™â˜ºï¸ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ Premote you're vote,positive
SOOO glad I made the switch from IHeart to Spotify! Never ever have I ran into a single technical malfunction or issue since using Spotify's Premium Duo subscription and I'm a customer for over a year now!,positive
"I hate the interface. I can't organize the feed so that what I WANT to see/hear is easily accessible, I end up with a bunch of 'recommended' stuff I don't want. I listen to one podcast; I shouldn't have to 'search' for it.",positive
It's ok it's just that it was different when I first got it you can listen to music but there ads that interrupt and I can't play my playlist anymore ðŸ¤·ðŸ½â€â™‚ï¸ðŸš«ðŸ§,negative
It's a really good app to use if you're a music lover,positive
Best music streaming app,positive
"Latest update has removed the play and pause buttons, please fix!",negative
The only reason I use this app is cuz it's the only app I don't have to pay for my music. But the amount of ads is horrendous. I get you gotta make money but damn. Over 1 billion people use this app I don't need an 5-6 ads after every song,negative
Podcasts are awesome. Please add more on regional languages (Preferably Bengali).,positive
Its a good app because if you are sad mood this app changed your mood in happiness and it is so amazing app and I am so happy because I have this app,positive
"How can you not give 5 stars to your own personel jukebox for $10 a month! As a music fanatic from a very early age to playing guitar for almost 40 years, this is the greatest thing technology can do for me, in my car, at home, on my phone, and they even have my album on here! ""KEGASAURUS WRECKS"" c'mon man! Thank you Spotify!!",positive
The app is becoming more and more unstable with every update. I am an Android 12 User. No feature works as it should. Lyrics aren't shown correctly I have to restart app to see lyrics with each song. It doesn't remember which song I was listening to when I used the app last time. It also doesn't show the notification I have to open the app again and again. It's such a drag using the app.,negative
"Music selection ok, but gets repetitive and only seems to stick to a relatively limited selection of songs by any particular artist (unless you listen to a playlist that is purely that artist). The most annoying thing is that the ads are significantly louder than the music, intrusive, patronising (especially Spotify's own ads) and excessive. There is also no way to customise ads. I get ads are necessary, but I will NEVER give money to this company given their obnoxious and abusive ad tactics.",negative
One of the best playlist ever made,positive
Best music app ever,positive
"I've been using Spotify for years and I love it! The only problem that I have is that whenever I make a playlist that is only about an hour long, Spotify adds songs I don't want. Now I am listening to a playlist and everytime I skip a song that they added it goes to another one they added. Please change this it is very annoying and not fair if I'm trying to customize a playlist for myself.",negative
I had iHeartRadio for a long time but I love Spotify even better so thank you,positive
I love this app it's a great way to listen to music and express yourself the only thing is I wish you didn't have to pay so much to get rid of ads cos the ads are really annoying. Other than that it's amazing,positive
I don't understand why after every 2 songs they put a long 30s ad...I don't why this app so much acts like of being so poorðŸ˜¬,negative
"I enjoyed listening to the songs even though my cignal was weak,it never stops playing the songs",positive
Great music and friendly user loving itðŸŽ§ðŸ’¯,positive
Most recent update is rubbish. Podcasts and music keep pausing mid stream for a second or so on a strong connection. The currently playing band is gone (who thought this was a good idea). Currently playing in the drop down is also wrong. Even the actually playing app has the play symbol implying it's paused. So many bugs for a paid service.,negative
Music. Glad I found Spotify!!,positive
"The app tells me to go online in order to get search results. While I don't have a great connection, I do have a connection. In fact, I am writing this 1 star review via my connection right now",negative
Love the lyrics option and app is light on data use. ðŸ˜,negative
Fantastic and free!,positive
Great app. Good tunes! Good podcasts.,positive
The new update is incredibly nice and sound quality is good! Spotify Premium is truly worth it. I absolutely recommend Spotify more than other music streaming services. Thank you Spotify! ðŸ˜Š,positive
The February update broke Spotify connect to my car's Bluetooth radio is no longer able to connect to Spotify,negative
Best app just please a little lesser adds and some good songs aren't there which isn't good but overall alright,positive
Spotify needs to stop charging my debit card for an individual plan. I am on a family plan that my relative pays for with their banking info.,negative
It's a lot different from Pandora I can actually make my own playlist send them to friends I can listening to podcasts and everything. Overall good app but you really need to fix Those ads I got 11 in a row before I was allowed to listen to my music and then after listening to two songs I got 16 in a row so you really need to fix that ad problem.,negative
Keeps cutting out during songs may need to find something else,negative
Its very good but maybe make unpaid better. I have premium and its great so maybe make unpaid a little like premium please.,negative
Exceptional clear music,positive
Jkartel is the best artist on Spotify but he's very underrated,negative
"SPOTIFY just Stopped working suddenly, please respond Asap, thanks.tell",negative
This is good AP I have ever use but their are some gilch so Spotify have to fix it,negative
"The app started closing on its own since the last update, have to open it again and choose a playlist",negative
good,positive
I love it cus this app contens a lot of international songs and it have storys tooðŸ˜ƒ,positive
"There's some issue in the new version I suppose. It's not showing the song which is being played. The complete tab is missing, we can't either pause, or goback or go to next song. Have to close the tab and start the app again n again. Fix this one.",negative
Keeps glitching and doesn't show me what song is playing anymore... also doesn't give me the symbol to connect to devices like my Google home,negative
Really lovely music you can choose from any songs that you want,positive
"It's good and the experience was not bad ,but can you add download option plssðŸ’Œ",positive
"Its Great app, No complaint so far.",positive
The app is always crashing always has trouble loading podcasts. The worst is when an add comes on and after the add is done the podcast I'm listening to skips right to the end. Total waste of time,negative
Its easy to search our faviorate song fastly,positive
Just plain terrible. Will not show my downloaded podcast when I go offline. If I could find another to use I would.,negative
Too many option hidden for non premium. I cannot choose one song from an album and have to listen songs which i do not like. Suck!,negative
"Highly pleased with the Spotify app - functions very well on my phone and tablet. As a business, I respect that they have stood up against calls for censorship. It seems to be a great home to podcasts for people who want to be informed and think for themselves.",positive
"Please fix the Downloads. I pay extra to have them, I should get them. They tend to break or just not download and it is frustrating.",negative
App is easy to use and the music is best .,positive
You suggest us to create our own playlist yet you play the song that didnt even listed in our list. You fckng donkey,negative
I love Spotify but my rating isn't budging until you fix the glitches. 50% of the time when I go to play a song it immediately skips it and goes to something else. Infuriating beyond belief. Please let us swipe right on ANY song to add to queue. Currently we can't swipe to add songs in the search bar or songs in an enhanced playlist to queue. Why???? Anyway great app but seriously that glitch is going to make me launch my phone at the nearest child.,negative
Music keeps pausing for no reason. So frustrating.,negative
It has been beautiful experience and I am anticipating innovative and revolutionary content on the platform.,positive
"Very annoying app for the Android version. Yes, I am using the free version, but it does not mean I cannot back track a playlist, only giving forward/next track option. Cruel thing you have got. I still prefer the PC version. And if you like get the Windows version spoilt too.",negative
Why you think adding songs to my playlist is good idea? What do you think? I don't know what I want? You socks!,negative
Quit screwing with Bluetooth! You're going to cause someone to wreck trying to play a damn song!,negative
Latest update has killed my Spotify through Android auto. I cannot play music in the car at all,negative
My all time music app,positive
good variety just too many ads without premium,positive
When i want to play it on my prem its so bad it keep changing the sounds its litteraly kinda bad so please when its on playlist dont change the song example im gonna play badguy - billie but when the song done the song next song was happy pills but its not its litteraly some annoying ads i dont like it..,negative
Great new music weekly. And if you download the music you can listen still offline,positive
"Having issues with the media player disappearing every now and again, usually after connecting to a device via Bluetooth. Once disconnected it carries on playback through the phone speaker, but with no media player showing it can't be paused or stopped. Apart from that, happy with the service.",negative
Good selection of music,positive
"Not to happy. Found out despite having the same plan, I was paying more on my mom's account I was paying for than mine. Canceled our subscriptions.",negative
It's as good as the desktop app bar a few missing features. None of which spring to mind ATM...,positive
"Playlist's Add to home screen feature don't work at all. I can't download a single song individually, I've to download an entire playlist. Consumes a lot of internet. It's removing my favourite songs day by day.",negative
I love the selection! There is such a range of choices. Great job Spotify.,positive
Works horribly. And what about the 30 minute break before ads? That surely isn't the case here,negative
Latest update caused many problems. I am on an Android phone and the app is not working properly any more. Please fix the issue.,negative
"Even i have subscribe for a years, lyrics won't showed up, fix this!!",negative
"awful app. if you need to buy premium just to play the songs you want, might aswell put Spotify not for free. because i cant even listen to the songs i want to listen and could only skip 6 songs an hour.",negative
"The app is normally great, but the last 2 days I don't have any controls. It's very annoying! Please fix this.",negative
I hate it it keeps on adding random songs to my Playlist please don't get this app,negative
Everytime I try to play a playlist that has a low number of songs in it just adds random songs I don't want to listen too.,negative
"Since the update, if you select a song to play, it just skips the current song you are playing and plays something else. Have to keep going out of the app and going back in to select the song you want.",negative
I've started experiencing bugs where the media controls disappear and I have to completely kill the app and restart to get them back.,negative
"I love that they did not remove Joe rogan, there's disgusting hateful and racist stuff coming through music and podcast of all kinds. Removal of Joe Rogan would have established a very bad precedent. Good job Spotify for treating everyone equally. The app works great too.",negative
Every other streaming platform gives us HD streaming quality at the same price as their low end. Spotify still hasn't offered HD at all. And they pay artists nothing. I'm close to leaving them for Amazon.,negative
"Its astounding how everytime i load up this app, something is wrong with it. Just now I tried favoriting a new album to my library, it says it saved, but it's not there when i try to open it. I try playing any kind of music? It gives me an ad that says its 10 seconds long and then gets stuck on that ad for 2 minutes!! Of dead air!! This is why i dont ever want to try premium either.",negative
"The only problem that i want to suit is the ADDS, There is always adds every next music lol please reduce it tho for free user. It is okay if the adds only appear every 2 to 3 time in a playlist.",negative
This app has become really really bad. Keeps saying I have no internet connections which I do. Sound does not sound good on certain albums. Takes ages and ages to open an album or track and when playing an app it just stops playing altogether This needs to be fixed ASAP!!!!!!!! Definitely not happy at all ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”. Not good enough seeing how I am paying for this app.,negative
"I like how there's also covers and not just the original singers and also how there's songs from different countries too. And I also like how we can make our own playlist and coustomize it how ever we like.And there's also potcast too since I sometimes listen to ""someting scary"". Overall I really enjoy listening my music and postcast in Spotify.",positive
Good But ads aargh!,negative
"A great podcast platform! Also, love the dark background.",positive
"I use this app everyday. At home, in the car, at the gym, on a walk, etc. I definitly recommend the SPOTIFY app!",positive
"How do I refresh ALL my downloaded playlists at once, after my 1 months trial has run out & I've put Â£10 back on, all my playlists need refreshing, BUT I can't find a Refresh ALL Button anywhere?",negative
Worst experience ever I've buyed 1 month subscription and just after that my Spotify is not responding anymoreðŸ¥²,negative
"Premium user for years. It's difficult to report issues / find support outside of very basic user issues using their website. Podcast feature was a nice add but the Your Episodes Playlist is limited and messes with downloaded episodes unnecessarily. Recently there's been issues with the queue not working properly. I will rearrange in the queue and by the end of a song/episode, it will clear. Debating if it's worth paying for premium or if I should start researching other services to replace it.",negative
I thought going premium meant the end of adverts,negative
Absolutely perfect music app ðŸ‘Œ Recommended for those who loved music like me â˜ºï¸,positive
This app is poggers they have every song except I'm trying to follow my friend and I can't find his profile.,negative
"I've been using Spotify for over 3 years, and I havent had a problem until now. The app is constantly crashing, lagging or malfunctioning. Alongside that, the preview feature when adding songs to playlists was taken away, which is extremely annoying.",negative
Good platform that believes in free speech. Please don't cave to cancel culture.,positive
"Though not bad enough. But the we want to play, it plays another one. That is annoying thing.",negative
Excellent music streaming application! Recently subscribed for 1 year. Very satisfied. Two thumbs up!,positive
"I've never had many complications with this app! It has too many functions to count, and almost has everything I search for",negative
App has continuously gotten worse and have to unistall it frequently to get it to work,negative

"Since I got my new Samsung Galaxy S22+, music wont play inbthe background when I play Beachbody on demand. Anyone else have that trouble? Aside from that, good app.",positive
I think Spotify is great!,positive
"Daily pushes the subscription fee. You don't use it, it pushes. You go into the settings and tell the app no notifications and you still get rubbish through. Terrible app that is now uninstalled.",negative
"Everything is perfect except 1 thing, you cant choose what song you listen to when you want to listen to it, unless you pay for it.ðŸ™„",positive
Wide variety of music for different moods,positive
Just amazing the fact that even if youve got smal data the app will work correctly I always like to stream music on this app before you start to rent it they gives anyone free listening for about a month so that after you can start to rent it very fantastic,positive
"Premium is definitely worth the $. By far, my favorite app.",positive
I can get all the songs I want to listen to except I hate Love by Toni Braxton. Tidal has better sound but consumes more data (HiFi or not). I like how Spotify's data saver is always on and I barely use any data.,negative
Love being able to have music all the time!,positive
Still the best music app. But: - no lossless - you can't minimize player by swiping like in ios version,positive
"Ads over ads, over other ads, on top of some more ads, under other ads. only 6 skips per hour. have to trial songs in order to hear what I like. Your to gready and it shows. Not for me , good bye",negative
wish I like,positive
"App is good, but all songs are still not available. it shows this songs are not available in your region. hope they solve this ðŸ™‚ 3 stars for now",negative
Keeps cutting off and doesn't show what's playing,negative
Best music app but there are not all the song from YouTube,negative
Good range of music,positive
"Wonderful on PC, not so much on mobile, otherwise I would have given five stars.",positive
So far I'm good with you. My problem is these ad's are too many and too long,negative
"I love Spotify, but this issue really needs to get fixed. I can't skip songs or pause music or even check what's playing without completely shutting down the app and reopening, and that only fixes the problem for a couple of minutes before the app freezes again.",negative
"Bruh, whenever u play spotify and you answer a call. there's a bug that spotify will play a music while u call (switch to speaker). actually mf this is disgustang. plz help with it",negative
I'll give this a 5/5 if you guys stop making me listen to the advertisement I can't skip it,positive
"User-friendly,can use other apps at the same time and doesn't drain my battery!",positive
I love making my own playlists and the ability to play them back in the car using Android Auto hands free.,positive
I like it due to Batman podcast I downloaded it and bought the pack it is awesome,positive
Not sure how to work this app music,negative
Good app for song,positive
More like 4.5 but I do enjoy Spotify,positive
Can there be any other app that consistently makes the user experience worse with every update? The song you are playing now covers the last item in a playlist folder so it cannot be selected. With so many options - at better quality - I'm getting very close to ditching spotify.,negative
"Useless App mega bugs very frustrating to use. Other music apps auto start in my car. This version of Spotify does not, it used to autostart. Once you get Spotify running podcasts and music will randomly stop. I'm seriously thinking about stopping my premium membership.",negative
"Very good recommendation algorithm, but asks for micro transactions very frequently.",positive
"The BEST music app out there. I want play anything but SPOTIFY, its the only music app worth downloading! Thankyou SPOTIFY, for all the New&Old Best tunes from KickAss Music that reaches our ears each day bc of SPOTIFY!! ThankYou.",positive
Very good app you serach all type of song 1990 to 2222 i love it Thank you so much,positive
Pretty bad experience with the app often cutting out the music. Very temperamental and really making me contemplate moving to a different platform. App still syopping and not connecting to BT. Why do we put up with no fixes? Maybe if I stop paying?,negative
This update is the worst of them all. I no longer have the play and skips button or the ability to change where it is playing.,negative
I'm on my last nerve with Spotify I hope Spotify goes to hell ðŸ˜,negative
And mostly works as it should now From time to time it gets artists mixed up and songs I had previously saved in my playlist automatically change It still has the same name but the actual song itself is different For example one song I had saved changed to a remix version even though it was listed as the original and had been the original for three years up until that point,positive
the app has been crashing nonstop for me these past few days & it has never done that for me before,positive
Many people uninstalled it just because of the annoying ad made purposefully to annoy and get people on Spotify premium led to people stopped recommending it and switched to other apps . But the best music is here,positive
"Spotify was great when it first started however, I've been having to turn to youtube red due to all the Spotify bugs. Lately this app has been crashing, some of the crashes are exiting out randomly, not pulling up my DOWNLOADED songs which shouldn't be an issue, not pulling up the app at all and finally it won't let me restart the song it'll just keep playing when I hit back. This is my second 2 star review by the way, I left a review 3 months ago and I've seen little to no progress.",negative
"This app is great. I like it, the music is up to date and the quality is good as well.",positive
Too many ads.,negative
Great choices in music and Playlist I really enjoy it,positive

One of the best song streaming,positive
I love the app. Been using it for many years,positive

It's a best app for listening music,positive
"No cantopop radio & bad autoplay selection, very limited decades selection for cantopop",negative
"I use it everyday at least twice on my commute. My Liked Songs playlist is huge! I follow podcasts I never would have known existed. I like the sleep timer. I also love the Daily Lists made for me based off the songs I like listening to - this is how I find new songs, similar in sound to those I already love. I love this app, it makes me happy, and I'll happily pay for it each month forever.",positive
Shuffle doesn't work randomly. I get bored listening the same songs since they play over and over again.,negative
Stops playing music all of the time. I might get 2 songs before I have to reopen the app and hit play again. Will be switching to a new music platform... let's see how long before this comment gets removed by spotify.,negative
I love Spotify don't know what I would do without it,positive
"I listen in my car, on my motorcycle, in my boat and have play lists for each. Great app!",positive
Greatest music service ever.,positive
Too many bugs. I honestly might as well stick to YouTube because I get like 5 ads every 3 songs. The only thing that keeps me using this is the podcast and I have to uninstall and reinstall the app daily just to listen to them,negative
"Unfortunately, I have tried to put this programme on my phone and although I already have an account it, doesn't accept the password and I just went around in circles. Therefore after the third attempt I just gave up and uninstalled it. I'm afraid I won't be able to use it. Maybe there is another music app out there. Sorry.",negative
"I'm quite frustrated with this app; lyrics were added to all of my devices with spotify a month ago, but it still won't update on my phone!!! ðŸ’¢ Anyone know how to fix this???",negative
Excellent arrangement and easy to create a playing list,positive
"I think the app has a bug. I already tried the premium mini for a numerous times because I like to listen to various songs offline. And I can say it is a wonderful experience not until this time. Every time I download songs and go offline it says that there are no downloaded songs. Thus, I have to bear the hassle of reconnecting to an internet connection and carefully not exit the app to redownload the songs. This is because once the app is closed, the downloads would be gone again.",negative
"This is my favorite app when it comes to listening music, but recently, whenever i press the play button, spotify automatically stops and back to homescreen. Please fix it!",negative
Currently the navigation bar is missing when playing content. Unable to pause etc.,negative
You can't sort your songs. For instance all the songs I've starred are ordered oldest first on my phone (yet on my PC it's newest to oldest). They used to have this EXTREMELY BASIC FEATURE but removed it for some reason. DO NOT USE. Imagine developing an app of lists and not have the ability to sort...waste of money,negative
It's become worse.... Now it's not even opening... Always notifys that Spotify isn't responding. Pls fix this irritating Bug spotify.... Cmon... U are the. No. 1 music streaming app... Can't have all these bugs.,negative
"The app is fine, nothing wrong with it but my payment plan isn't Woking and its been working for almost a year now. Please try and fix the issue at hand because its rejecting my payment",negative
"wish we could get premium thru google play card, also why does it play different random songs that arent on my liked playlists, its wasting my skips",negative
Very nice app I kust love this app,positive
The new shuffle play algorithm kinda sucks and plays the same 30 songs over and over even though I have over 1000 songs saved,negative
I pay premium. Spotify keeps logging me out of the app meaning I need to enter my password every few days which is annoying and ridiculous. Also the shuffle option algorithm isn't great- it plays the same songs over and over almost in the same order. It feels like I listen to the same 100 liked songs over and over again,negative
When i play song it close the app immediately After uninstall the app . Installing the app after 1-2 week it is properly working but again it doing that thing then i uninstall it . It is uninstall for a 3 week but the problem doesn't solve please solve it and the app is very goodðŸ‘ðŸ‘,positive

Very nice selection of music,positive
Worst music app . I like Amazon music much better. They keep on piping adds after every 2 songs . You can't hear songs peacefully unless you area premium user . Such bad interface . I don't recommend using this app,negative
What's not to like? My playlists help through good times and bad,negative
I used to have pandora but switched to this and never looked back highly recommend switchingðŸ’¯ðŸ‘Œ,positive
Missing a real random shuffle.,negative
It's overall a good app sure it's pretty annoying without Spotify premium on a phone but apart from that good,positive
Ads app ðŸ¤¡... limit the adds,negative
"Periodically stops and starts podcast episodes I've downloaded. Will lose play bar, so cannot play/pause. Have to force stop app to get it to stop playing",negative
i love spotify but idk if its just me but when i go to add a song to my playlist to listen to later i have to listen to the whole playlist instead of getting to pick the song i wanted :/ i would have to wait it out till i got to the song i wanted. i would rlly like to be able to pick a song that i want and same thing with albums i dont want to have to listen to the whole album i just wanbt to choose the song i wanted to listen to..so it'd be great if i could.thx!,negative
I can't have a lyric displayed on my spotify. It's been almost a 3 year problem of mine. Maybe someone here can help me out.,negative
"Didn't get some lyrics feature, like share lyrics and translated lyrics",negative
"I really like Spotify but the whole problem is because of shuffle, I don't even know why the hell they had to add shuffle, it's making us beyond impossible to listen to the song we want, what if we want to listen to Justin Bieber but coco melon plays instead? I bet Spotify never understands our problem and all they tell us that if we want shuffle off, buy premium. What about the broke people here? What if they are so addicted to Spotify when they can't even play their favorite song? Pls fix this",negative
Good app,positive
The enhanced feature on playlists singlehandedly makes spotify the hands-down only music app choice,negative
KEEP SPIRIT,positive
Why i can't play the song? I have paid for premium,negative
Really nice music app I use to collect cds alot but then my dad told me Spotify is good so I did and now just download music,positive
...Spotify is my favorite Music App!!...love making my own playlists!!...,positive
"pretty good, adds annoying and cant get premium but overall great",positive
"This app is amazing, I use a lot but when I type in a song it doesn't always give me the results I need plus I can't press back to change to a different song. Over all, amazing app! ðŸ‘",negative
Great app for music,positive
"I love this app,use it all the time but I hate when spotify adds songs to my playlists. as someone who cant listen to anything that isnt in my playlists without having a meltdown. I would like if you could atleast be able to turn it off in settings.",negative
"This works just fine, sometimes! then a new feature gets pushed and there is a new bug that makes you suffer would be nice if we could opt in to beta test instead of getting force feed new experimental ui changes Still got the same bug that makes part of the ui invisible and renders the app useless",negative
I like it you can also set your alarm to a lot of things even podcasts and more,positive
"Had a 160 hour playlist before I got a free trial of premium, wasn't able to afford to pay for premium, so my playlist got cut down to 32 hours and I'm not a happy camper.",negative
The pop up screen of the track does not pop up at the bottom sometimes. I cannot loop tracks . This is annoying. However make sure to pay for premium always reliable to find every song.,negative
"For a while they removed the feature to preview songs before you add them to a playlist, but they added it back, so I'm giving 4 stars because it's a really good app to use (as long as you have premium), but I don't like how the features that are the reason I pay for Spotify can just be taken a way on a whim for months.",negative
I get what I want when I want it. Outstanding!,positive
I've always relied on Spotify since inception. An improvement would be staying on top of licensing so we don't lose those hard to find tracks.,positive
App is good but they indirectly force you to get a subscription,positive
So hard to just play one song adds song to your playlists very annoying,negative
This review is edited i have been having issues that are really irritating whenever i am in another app or playing a mobile game my music will randomly stop and i have to go back into the app and play it sometimes it replays all over again the whole entire song i do not know what to do i need help and it is driving me nuts.,negative
It's an app that is easy to use and convenient for listening to your favorite songs!,positive
Enjoy the music so much and particularly the ease and using this application and the wide selection of artists,positive
"The free version is useless. It only made me aggressive. The app doesn't remember that it already played the ""once every 30 min"" ad. And bombards me with ads. Never bringing this trash to the gym again. I rather bring a power bank. Useless and very much overhyped.",negative
"It's been an awesome experience listening to music on Spotify, with this App I can easily tuned into an atmosphere of worship. Thanks to the developer ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘",positive
"Have just read other reviews and feel reassured. Over recent updates/months recurring problems haven't been rectified for Bluetooth. Music CONSTANTLY pauses regardless which device I'm using. Keep getting message box saying 'allow Bluetooth' when it's on. Just listened to BBC Sounds for two hours, no problems; same on other apps. One more update then I'm cancelling. Not paying over Â£200 per year for this!",negative
It holds the best music even from old times,positive
"Love it so far!! Especially since it's commercial free, unlike YouTube Music ðŸŽ¶",positive
"I mean it's a good music app with good artists, it would be 5 stars if the listen together option worked though",positive
"If you can avoid installing Spotify, do it. Service is garbage yo",negative
A bit bad cause when i try to play cpr it played something else and it keeps happening when i try to play new songs it keeps playing something else,negative
"I love the app if I could rate it out of then I'd say nine though, the reason is because the ads are soo annoying but overall I like the app it has various options of music and you can find most songs that you want",positive
I can't get myself out from the house or car this music is the best thing I ever need to get my situation going on with the music you have it is such a variety of Great music so keep up with the good music you guys I love it !!!!!!!,positive
"I don't like the new update, I was using spotify cause it was legal to listening music without using youtube, but since the newest update, I can't choose songs it was random and I need to listen till the end, I could skip but there was a limit to do that. Please bring back the old spotify",negative
"To many ads and the limitations on skipping songs is ridiculous, you also should be able to search for a song and listen to the exact song and not have to listen to similar songs, doesn't make sense at all, if you are searching for a song to listen to you should be able to listen to it...",negative
Awesome experience Clear playlist and Songs,positive
"As a premium user, I can't comment on the ads since I don't get any. The daily mixes have gotten a lot better. Newer features like finding music from lyrics on search bar are actually helpful and intuitive. It would be better if it had different audio options like 8D. Also they do not have ALL songs like yt which could be annoying.",negative
"Spotify is the perfect app for listeners, fans and creaters to share and inspire lives.",positive
There's one request for Spotify please add recently added songs,negative
Super and nice songs to enjoy music,positive
"App is garbage now, randomly removes songs from playlists and removes downloaded songs entirely",negative
"Volume is too low to hear on Bluetooth speaker at work, like half of the volume of YT Music",negative
Just got premium about a week or so ago and now if I skip 6 songs instead of having to sit through ad after ad it crashes everytime instead,negative
New update sucks... U can't play liked songs please change it,negative
This is Amazing   ,positive
It been pretty cool wish that i had more than six skips but it fine like the app.,positive
Very good app it deserves five stars . It's a good music app probably the best and has no problems there isn't any I've seen actually,positive
Real cool,positive
"Its a good app, and has lots of the older music that you sometimes cant even find on YouTube. However, my main issue is that it adds songs to your playlists for you, with no warning. Ill play a playlist that Ive made sure is clean (christian family), and a song will pop up that is really gross, screwed up, and has way to much profanity for me to be able to listen to it. I would like it if this autoadd feature was removed, or had a way to disable it in settings.",negative
"Spotify banners and widgets overheat battery. Still, Spotify is dream come true for me. Everything I need for my music. No drama. No load up times, massive selection I haven't been unable to find a track as yet and I listen to some crazy stuff. One thing tho I listen to metal, d and b a bit of hip hop blah blah on your latest suggestions for me you offered James Blunt...really Spotify. Lol. Get this app if you love music.",positive
Recent update is now making app crash ðŸ™„ðŸ¤” not gonna lie it's well annoying.,negative
I really enjoy the research that spotify provides based on my music and genre choices.,positive
It keeps randomizing the music I can't stop it it needs to stop showing me the album of the song I wrote I deleted it because it keeps stressing me out I can't listen to the song I want and when I do find it it's just 10 seconds of it I had the song in my liked and albums but now I can only listen 10 seconds of it and switching the song to others please fix it,negative
Too much ads without any reason!!!,negative
"I'd give more stars if we were given some info on what the upgrades are when they're available. A quick description would be really helpful, it's silly that such a large app doesn't do that.",negative
"Sometimes it says I'm offline even tho I'm using a crt wifi like I'm in online net is working perfectly.but, it says I'm offline",negative
"Spotify is literally the best. You can listen to any song you want and it's better than the competition. Only downside is the 4 advertisements that play every 15 minutes. Other than that though, Spotify is great.",positive
I love Spotify! Please keep making the app better! We need In it to win it by saliva back on Spotify,positive
Encourage people to buy premium not force them to buy premium,positive
Every time I asked for a song it was there!!,negative
Excellent,positive
Love Spotify. Great service for the price.,positive
It's a really good music app and Injoy it alot and it always has new music every week for u to listen to.,positive
"I find it very difficult tobdownload songs with and I am on a premium plan. The app just keeps showing download but never does, I have to always stream!!! And why cant we download songs individually? Unless we add to playlist?",negative
Good ðŸ‘ experience. Gives me what I want in different genres of music.,positive
App doesn't open. Black screen!,negative
Gives you ads a lot and you get like 10 30 seconds ads in a row,negative
New update is awful. Cannot see the player anymore and have to physically close the application to stop music. Fix this!,negative
"Hi, the music is good but there are too many ads for premium it says adds will come after 30 minutes but after every 2 songs ads come and it's irritating so please remove some ads, that is why gave it4 star's",negative
Simple to use...suggestions are easy to use and easy with a simple ðŸ‘Œ play button,negative
Money by Lisa has been replaced with an unauthorized song with identical name. It's been 4 days but you keep ignoring the fans. You are not doing immediate action to fix this problem. Are you really busy enough?? It's been 4 days and no respondðŸ˜¤,negative
"Great app for listening music, not much ads but I personaly don't like that on some playlists you can change just six songs per hour",negative
Excellent app for music lovers!,positive
mostly the app is good no issue I have to faced but the problem is Lyrics just imrove it's very important thing that i found after this mostly everything is fine,positive
Thank you Spotify for filling up my free time...,positive
I only just downloaded Spotify because my 9 year old daughter wanted to listen to music. Well haven't I been missing out. I now use it everyday and i love it,positive
So unlike other people i cant turn off shuffle play ...i dont have the arrow buttons and im stuck on shuffle play but otherwise this is the best music app u wont regret downloading it,positive
"I want to love this, I do, and on my phone it works great, on my laptop it keeps logging me out",positive
This app is perfect! It has so many songs on it but the problems are that u need internet and it has so many adds,negative
"I accidentally delete the spotify data, yeah that's my fault. But I try to reinstall it and now I just stuck in the logo loading screen",negative
Before you did the update I could go from song to song but now I can't I liked it the way it was,negative
"It would be a 5 star if only it didn't occassionally bounce to other random songs when I don't have shuffle on, then again it may just be me, but for the most part it's pretty good to use for music and stuff",positive
Great finding all the songs I want and ones I never knew about,positive
"Worst music app ever! I built a playlist and the only option is to shuffle play. Used to be able to select any song i wanted, not anymore. Way better on the pc than mobile.",negative
Easy to use and lots of great songs.,positive
It's really nice. Love the fact that they set a whole playlist of different artists all together,positive
"Please make it easier to get to the equaliser, from the current song menu would be great, deezer has this function. Why is it so hidden?",negative
"I love all the music selections, but I have to give this 1 star. It takes up a ton of space and there are so many adds. I listen to more adds than music.",positive
"Would be better if my freaking notification area wasn't always bugged. Seriously sick of it. That and I don't get half my podcasts showing a lot of the time until I reset the app 100 times, noticed it's the Daily Wire pods especially. Yep, and again today, was listening to a podcast that's mysteriously disappeared again of course it's a conservative one. Will be canceling if this keeps up",negative
"hate it, where the hell did the skip button is? And i can't choose what to listen to . It always gives me random songs when I click one, and I hate the shuffle thing, I want to pick what I want from my personal playlist. I tried downloading lite and it was good for a while until the same problem is happening, am moving.",negative
Love how Spotify always plays what I want to hear! And I love the lyrics section and the hand- picked Playlists!! Can't live without it!,positive
Loving the variety of genres,positive
Best music predictor. Not a miss in the bunch.,positive
"While the recommendations work great, the app desparately needs the following features (basic stuff really) IMO 1. ArtistS, composers, albums and songs category/tabs in library 2. Option to select individual tracks to download instead of whole playlist/album.",negative
There's no straightforward way to stop it from auto playing whenever it connects to my car. So I deleted the app. Also red hot Chilli peppers don't belong in A perfect Circle radio.,negative
I love ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’• listen to podcasts and music,positive
This app is all around perfect I recommend to any and everybody that loves and enjoys listening to music!,positive
"I'm so in love with this app! But I don't have an option for the equalizer, tried support and there is instructions on how to but I don't have it on my paid premium app.",negative
Crashing. Ever since the new update it crashes. A LOT! Thinking about canceling my subscription if they can't fix it.,negative
"This app is great don't get me wrong but I think the recent update broke it, because im having the same issue everyone else is having 1.Task bar disappearing and 2. Music cutting off sometimes when I put it in sleep mode",negative
"Even when I'm paying for it I still get pop up ads. Frick off Also, the tv app is truly terrible. No playback speed control, overly simplified UI, reduced options to choose in the home page, almost no ability to look at previously played, search function is clumsy. Seems designed at showing you their recommendations and the most popular/highest paying of your recent listens, but not chronologically. Garbage design for users, I'm about to quit. Winamp 25 years ago had better functionallity.",negative
This is the best app in the history of all apps; I'm obsessed,positive
I can listen to my favourite music whenever I choose! I love it.,positive
Spotify is better on ever platform phone is garbage you can't chose what song you like and you can do that on other platforms,negative
"Third class application. Even after connected to wifi it showing no internet connection. Spotify, please improve application instead of adding ads. Such loose marketing it is.",negative
This aap is good ,positive
Spotify is the best hands down music app that is on the web I'll never use another app for my music,positive

The best app ever I can listen all songs here no matter which language plus I can see most of the lyrics here soooo mine one and only favorite app is Spotify I love it,positive
"Very poor music app when you're not subscribed, even when you do pay you run into Playlist errors, next to useless search engine, list goes on really just keep scrolling",negative
I enjoy spotify way more than Amazon music. It works way better!,positive
"I would have given Spotify a 4 or 5 star rating but no, not now! I don't know what is wrong with Spotify, if I hear a song or any podcast it plays initially but as soon as the screen goes off the voices begin to shatter, it begins to crack like I am connected to a poor network connection and as soon as I turn on the screen everything sets back to normal. Is this some kinda bug we've to deal with, it's really very annoying. It works well on ios devices, my iPad, everywhere, but why not on android",negative
The weird left hand side update is awful!,negative
Its out of rhis world. No words ro desscribe. Its an Awesome expeeience,positive
Great app brilliant music the best,positive
"Entertaining, ease of use and good layout. Could be better without having artists or genres i do not listen to fill up my homescreen.",positive
very great app and not too expensive to go âœ¨premiumâœ¨,positive
The best music app ever !!!! The best part is the playlist they have !!! And the option to save them in your library and share your personal playlist across your friends and family.,positive
"Not sure if it's my phone's fault or Spotify, but when listening on my Bluetooth headphones the streaming quality sometimes suffers. The ability to make and share playlists or collaborative playlists is one of my favorite features of the app.",negative
just the ads r useless lol,negative
Most songs are accessible.,positive
Awesome app with not just music but valuable podcasts.,positive
"For me, Spotify is a million times better than YouTube music. One of my biggest gripes with YouTube music was that I couldn't play music in the background. Spotify fixes that! Honestly, I fell in love as soon as I figured out that I could listen in the background. ðŸŽ¶",positive
If they don't support the constitution I am out. I removed all apps from my devices. Return all covid related items back to Spotify. Your not a publisher!,negative
My all feeling in this app. When I listen song then my brain in come shantiiðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„,positive

i love Spotify can u please give me premium acc ðŸ˜ƒ,positive
"After updating everytime it needs to be updated, I can no longer play downloaded songs offline ( I cannot play the songs anymore even Im not connected to internet/data). Offline mode doesnt even work or seems useless. I've read other with same issue, I hope this will be solved soon. ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜” The lyrics for the songs as well, if you play it on PC, the lyrics does not fit the screen, sometimes delay.",negative
It's a great app but there's constantly updates which are annoying,negative
"The app have problems,I'm using premium plan for the first two month works perfectly,but now it totally can't use anymore,keep skipping songs and liked songs gone crazy and can't connect to the Internet.pls pls solve the problem ASAP.......",negative

"I work in a windowless basement that barely gets any type of signal. Luckily, spotify comes through and music saves me from going nuts.",negative
I hate how there is always ads ðŸ˜’ but other wise Allgood,positive
"I am a paying user and have been for over 4 years now and suddenly cannot log on to my android app at all, I keep getting told I'm offline, and to check my connection, clearly I am online. I have been dealing with this for over a day now. Fix this please or I'm cancelling my subscription.",negative
Jiosaavn is good,positive
App crashes itself after the last update,negative
Very nice app,positive
I got 2 months free of spotify premium and they do a bunch of premium deals! I always listen to this to vibe:),positive
Spotify is awesome!,positive
"Revert to an older version or fix your app!!! It is insane that your app has been broken for months. I've read articles how the now playing functions disappear so I know it's not just me. This should be something that could be fixed in a day once you were aware of the issue, and if you can't fix it, then revert to the last working version until you have the problem solved. It is beyond comprehension that I have to force close the app 5 times a day because I can't rewind or pause what's playing.",negative
Luv spotfy.luv alot Romantic slow music. That Spotify. Luv u ever made Spotify. B safe.,negative
Best features... But it will much better if it provides social interaction w strangers..... Liie chatting n all,negative
"There's a plenty of problem in this app right now.First, whenever I click on the I wanted it's always different song. It's really irritating and when I play songs in my playlist it always comes out in different ways and another song comes in between. The older version is better than this one right now",negative
Lets try this for a 3rd time mabey they wont delete it this time. Its a bad app that constantly crashes and freezes. Would not recommend,negative
Works great for the most part. But I've had to uninstall-reinstall 5 or 6 times because it glitches every few weeks.,negative
Very worst app. So many Ads coming,negative
Good app to listen end enjoy the music,positive
"Great app, has lots of music, just hate being interupted by ads and how it doesnt repeat your playlist but just starts playing other songs",negative
They making things easier and enjoying app to be in ever hour ,positive
"My Spotify keeps prompting offline even when on data. Have done troubleshoot, still same!",negative
Thank you for giving us a platform to follow up on our favorite artist with their amazing muzkic,positive
"After I log or sign in even after I make 100 different accounts when I add songs it shows a list of the artists at the top of my playlists and won't show me the songs and when I tap on my songs it only plays a few seconds of one part, I don't recommend this app anymore, started of well and ended like a dump",negative
Playlists are being rearranged at the speed of light- this is clearly a bug and reinstalling did not work to fix it,negative
Used to be good. But they just removed 80 or so episodes of the Joe rogan experience caving into extreme left demands to censor truthful speach,negative
brilliant. it's like the app is alive and adaptative to your changing musical taste. very personable,positive
"songs are good, but ads are pissing me off in my sleep",negative
It log outs automatically and does not login easily it login takes about 1 to 2 days. Please tell me how to fix this problem,negative
"Glitchy app.. first time in years this happened, music played even though i paused it, can't seem to view my current playing music. Please fix it asap (samsung s21+ android 12)",negative
it'd be fabulous if you were able to see what your friends listen to also on mobile,positive
"First time I'm seeing an app which makes it very very difficult to subscribe. I want to give money, but they are making it difficult. Losers.",negative
Just stop Chaand Baliya ads... ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ are there no other ads..??,negative
Something is wrong with Spotify!! Even when I'm online it says I'm offline. And I can't even access to my liked songs which I've downloaded already!!! Fix this ASAP,negative
"After uninstalled for months I am reinstalling this app . The previous reason for unistallation was , There were issues like we can't hear we want instead of it we have to went through playlists which we usually don't like and also '' THERE WAS NO FREEDOM OF HEARING "". Hopefully now there wouldn't be forceful policy to opt premium version.",negative
Very wonderful app... U can hear all kinds of language songs here.... Really loved it ðŸ¤©,positive
"I can't see the control to skip, pause, stop music, etc. Please fix this!",negative
I love music and I like that I can I mean love that I can put it on loop and the best part is that I can still listen to it while I playing a game or something so I think it deserves â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜† not like a â˜†â˜†â˜†,positive
"Artist radio feature is so broken, i d not believe it. Only a handful gets played over an over and if I click on a different song, app just doesn't recognise it. Holy moses. This is an app for music but could not play the song on a list its created.... Bruhhhhhhhhhh..... tell you ceo, he should hope 100bn from podcasts for sure as songs aren't playing.....",negative

Easy to filter and set favorites,positive
"I don't like Spotify cause other videos of song like playlist that i love is not even their! I more like YouTube that Spotify,i rather suffer listening to YouTube than Spotify. The only thing that is different about Spotify and YouTube is that you can play it while using other app and YouTube doesn't have it and some playlist from Spotify suck! And also the add you can't skip it ugh!",negative
Love how i have my music on shuffle but somehow manages to play the same 15 songs even though i got over 500,positive
Music is great even has some classics but it only lets you skip song 6 tims instead of as many times as you want and it dose not let you just listen to you're play list with out the suggested songs unless you have premium and it sucks.,negative
It's really a wonderful way to listen to my favorite music,positive
"I am canceling my account and uninstalling the Spotify app in support of Neil Young's position, and more importantly, in support of truth and integrity in journalism. When Spotify bars its pod casters from promulgating lies and disinformation, I will happily return.",positive
It's an amazing app i am enjoying alot and while listening music I go in my own imagination ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜it's amazing,positive
"Very good app,I like it a lot because stay playing the same tipe of music that I put it to play. A+",positive

Spotify has made me be more into different types of music and it has so many different things that you can listen to so what are you waiting for download SPOTIFY now!!,positive

"Hello team, Bring UPI and Net Banking facility in subscription payment options. Existing methods will ask for card details. Most people do not always have a debit / credit card on hand. If you change the payment methods, it will be useful for the users and increase the rate of your subscribers.",negative
Crashing every time I try to open it,negative
"Great music selection! Spotify includes hard to find groups and genres, like niche folk music from little known regions. I like that there's a free version of the app with friendly quirky ads :)",negative
"Glitchy app, too many ads, too many BAD programs with disinformation - app has really gone down hill. Uninstalled and cancelled",negative
Awesome I love the way you can do almost anything even without the premium in my opinion the #1 music app for me but I dont know if this happens only for me or for anyone else but they add song that I dont want to my playlist that's what I removed a star but I alse like the way you can watch an ad for no ads for 30 mins love it.,positive
It's a really nice app to stream song you love but I didn't give 1 start out by mistake but because the ads are really annoying and stupid. Why do you even put ads Spotify?,negative
It kept on switching from my favorite song to an unknown playlist that I don't like listening to. I want for you to please make an update that allows people to their favorite songs without having to switch to another playlist just because the favorite songs playlist is playing a song that is irrelevant to the songs that they have as favorites.,negative
Keeps glitching and switching itself off which isn't good enough when you pay for it and rely on it most of the day!,negative
"As of yesterday, 5/12/22, the app is unusable. I can't play any music and my playlists, liked songs, and any album I open does not load or loads incorrectly.",negative
You introduced a bug the makes the player(the area that shows the current song playing) window dissappear on Android.,negative
Listening to music is my safe place thank you Spotify for being my safe place,positive
Spotify is an amazing app to download. It provides great service and it has all of the music you can think of. There is next to none adds. It's a wonderful app and I recommend it to everyone.,positive
Good that one chooses what to listen to.,positive
"Bugs and features missing. There's been bugs on it. Recently, the playback buttons aren't showing up, even when you uninstall and update multiple times. I pay for Premium and it glitches from time to time.",negative
its great to share music and spark creativity. even better you can and have access to podcast that can truly change your life if and when you apply tried and tested principles they teach,positive
"When they roll out the HI-RES Audio option they will get 5 stars, before than it's just 3.",negative
"What happened to the playbar at the bottom of the screen? It's gone. Now I can only stop a song by closing the app. No rewind, pause, or fast forward. Hugely inconvenient...",negative
Easy way to hear yr favourite song â˜ºï¸,positive
"The sound is no good, the choice of artists is limited. Everything is overpriced and sketchy. Tidal is the way to go. Much better sound, better price, and many more artists to choose from.",negative
Best app for listening songs,positive
I like this app it makes we feel far happier with the high quality music,positive
Great music app doesn't drain ur data or battery.,positive
"The app is amazing! I really love the interface, its easy to use, and collation of suggested playlist is awesome",positive

Skips out and freezes/shuts down my whole phone whenever I try to play music. Cutting out as I'm typing this.,negative
"Unfortunately, I'm unable to continue my usage of Spotify while it provides a platform & funding for Joe Rogan to spread vaccine misinformation. Sad because I had just taken the leap to a Spotify Premium subscription a month ago. Also, the app sucks as a user experience if you don't have Premium (which I didn't have for the four years I've had the app).",negative
Every time I turn on on Spotify it keeps playing and won't turn off. I went into settings and it still won't stop,positive
Everything ia good with spotify,positive

"Whatever recent update has happened its wrecked it. So buggy, repeating songs, widget not responding, plays when it shouldn't, doesnt play when it should. Even plays 1 song while claiming to play something else. only solution is to force stop app and restart. So inconsistent now",negative
Extremely satisfying,positive
Best Music player ive had in a long time I even bought premium .,positive
Great app,positive
Thanks Excellent and very power fully good,positive
Almost every song you want to hear is on this app. The ads can get a bit annoying but otherwise an incredible music and podcast streaming app,positive
Everything is great but advertisements. Why is it so frequent? It's so annoying.,negative
Their capacity to suggest music based on favorites and song content is great. I never give reviews. Why should I? But this service has very good value. They now have lyrics. Whoa! Horsepower. Earthpower. Seapower. Just float along.,positive
"It's getting better each update!! Now even i can sort my playlist alphabetically without literally move the song one by one. Thank you, Spotify!",negative
"my ultimate fav music service. good looking app with ample music selection, even songs you had no idea were your fav. Recently it has been doing this weird thing where you cannot see what is playing So I cannot pause it or go forward from the player in the app. I need to delete the app and reinstall it. This is the third time I've had to do that. Please fix it.",negative
Best music app with the best prices. Can't go wrong,positive
The now playing bar has just disappeared and it is incredibly annoying. It will still play music if I choose a song but I cannot pause while in the app or even pause it outside of the all because the notification you get of whatever's playing also disappears when this happens.,negative
This spotify music touches the very thougth in mind . A true experince to listen.,positive
"I really enjoying spotify, the bestest app for listening music,stories and more. I spent more my time on spotify",positive
Great music of the 70s and 80s,positive
THANKS,positive
"The app's okay, and I like that I can close the app and the music can continue to play in the background. However, I can't get it to STOP playing in the background, unless I pause it. My most major issue with this app, is that, every time I try to play a song that I've already listened to before in the past, it doesn't play the song, it plays recommended songs from the recommended playlist, and I have no idea how to fix that. Also, my playlist won't play the correct songs.",negative
Nice apps,positive
"Spotify is absolutely awesome,",positive
Have a great deal if pay 9.99 a month you can skip and save your play list or 14.99 duo or 4.99 if you a college student and it worth the price.,negative

"I had really great experiences on Spotify, except I couldn't edit the playlists to put each song in it's own place on each playlist.... And.... I don't like that you add on songs that I haven't approved but other than that it was fantastic!",positive
I used to love spotify but lately it crashes every time i listen. It often plays music but there is no tab to control what plays or even see what the song is. Hopefully they fix it soon,negative
Great App use it for the Podcasts mostly.,positive
Resilience and efficiency,positive
Hello Spotify!! Please provide language setting to change the lyrics to English for all other songs in different languages like BTS songs the lyrics are only in korea it helps listen the songs on loop to learn the songs and lyrics and also I'm experiencing a lot of ad interruptions while listening to songs because of this I really cant listen more than a 30mins and I lost my interest to listen songs in this app,negative
It's an awesome app! It has all my favorite songs and I can listen to music all I want on it! ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜œ,positive
"It's a great app for listning music and my favorite show ""pertkotha""",positive
This app was going great for the first couple of weeks I've had it and now I can't control what song I listen to on my Playlist and I can't even change the song I'm listening to. What is also frustrating is that I've practically lost six and a half hours of Playlist.,negative
"This app always freezes, takes forever to load/skip songs, and always plays ""Heat of the moment"" by Asia. It's a very bad app",negative
"I'd love to give more stars, but recently the app has had a lot of issues. The biggest problem is when I minimize or have to close the app and then go back to resume listening, it won't bring up the song or podcast I was listening to. I have to force close it and open the app again to be able to get back to what I was listening to. Sometimes it also randomly moves to the next podcast or song when I haven't even touched it. This is very frustrating as I'm a premium member.",negative
"Haven't had it that long, but it is great to have calming music to go to sleep.",positive
I can play Roblox and listen to music good so good,positive
Takes care of all shade music and I love it. Yes it makes me happy,positive
You can't listen to a song you search up without spotify shuffling in more. I wanted to listen to the song I searched not these random others. Kinda defeats the purpose of a music listening spoof you can't play the song you want.,negative
Love the app! but it can be even better! I would love to add podcast to playlist.,positive
Its amaizing I enjoy listening to music and podcast the most!ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€,positive
"Spotify is awesome and works really great,but there is also a problem for me that it dosnt really let me play it in background,even if I allowed it.It just turns of completely at one moment,but that's not a giant problem.Also that sometimes the part that shows at what moment the song is playing and what song is playing dosnt appear sometimes,but it's also not a massive problem",negative
I have been using this for a couple of years and I love it keep it up spotify owners your doing amazing!!!,positive
Spotify is allowing misinformation against vaccines in its platform. Just canceled my subscription.,negative
There is no customer service number an ld the app is not working...there are no customer support...if you guys charge for premium membership shouldn't it be your responsibility to have a customer support team,negative
Link expired ..... why do I have to log in on to my account everyday and it doesnt allow me to log in? I put in my passwords and username but it doesnt . I have lost all my downloads many times,negative
"Tried the app on the my phone really enjoyed it, then found out it was just a preview. F.U. could have said it was just a preview, won't subscribe.",negative
"The free version is horrible. You can only skip 6 songs until 1 hour. Really. It's so stupid. Like I just want to listen to music freely. I don't mind adds here and then but please make at least 10 song skips. 6 is to low. Way to low. Can you ple3eeeaaaassee add ""Her Last Words- by Courtney Parker"" pleeeeeeeeeeaaaÃ aaaaasssseeeeee",negative
Better sound,positive
"This is the best music streaming platform around. I canceled my subscription as audio had weird, not-so-punchy bass, but I have now revisited the app and found that audio normalization is to blame. Now the bass is the same as other platforms. The app is stable and the overall experience is great. The music selection is quite rich and literally every device/OS supports Spotify, including WearOS. Overall, satisfied and will most likely subscribe.",positive
It's always a full filling experience listening to favorites and checking out the newest and greatest!!,positive
"After few updates... Bug with song in line wasn't fixed. When open album with songs they're in few lines(Text lines) , and you can't choose a song what you want to listen. Only what I can do it's push play button with a random song(in album) , and I've had a feeling what's literally plays random from author (from Others album's too). Probably it's just a feeling, but still... It's a good program for listening music(when bug doesn't appeared)....... (ëˆˆâ€¸ëˆˆ)",positive
I enjoy having my Spotify very convenient.,positive
It's a good streaming service. Occasionally they remove songs and podcasts that has been downloaded and redownload them again,positive
"It's cool ðŸ˜Ž for free, even with some advertisements.",positive
"it crashes literally every few songs. edit: it still crashes every few songs but instead of opting to fix this, they have removed the Shuffle Liked Songs feature. stop shooting yourself in the foot. edit: the crashing is worse now. i will switch to tidal.",negative
Because you can listen to music and they fixed all the stuff and I love this app very much That's why I gave it a five star rating :},positive
App freezes every minute. Tried every solution online,negative
A great platform of music.,positive
"What a ridiculous amount of Ads. Nine in and haven't heard a song yet ... nine before I decided to come here and comment. They are still going. Then, once a song starts, even if you don't finish it, you'll get an ad before the next one plays, only one ad if you are lucky. Terrible app. Interface is lacking, can't find songs easily enough. They don't even pay artists very well. No thanks.",negative
This is very good song app ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ,positive
"Great thanks , easy to use",positive
Good functions well designed,positive
I can't be the only person that's having this issue of not being able to listen to my downloaded songs offline. That's the whole reason I downloaded them. It's quite annoying and inconvenient and I hope it's fixed in the soonest,negative
New to Spotify... So far so good.,positive
Every day I experience some infuriating glitch that makes using this app impossible. It is incredible to think Spotify has been making this app for a decade and still can't make it work at reasonably expected level.,negative
I don't know why but the app every time im turn off like a system like speaker the panel of play pause forward is not showing up,negative
The app is good but Spotify isn't responding on peoples complaint and reports especially on twitter. Please respond on fans tweets because some song are unable to play in some playlist especially on Today's Top Hit playlist.ðŸ§ Edit: song like money by Lisa is currently unable to play. Spotify please fix this issue!!!!,negative
"They asked me to rate the app, so I'm rating the app. They chose a helluva time to make this push.",negative
Easy to use great range of music and podcasts as well as audiobooks 100% would recomend over any other music app,negative
"Really interesting but sometimes it misbehaves. Though, the goods surpasses the bads. Love the app anyways. ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘",negative
This app is trash. You need to pay in order to enjoy this app. Broke people like me wont ne enjoying this because you cannot skip song and random songs will pop out even it's not part of your playlist. You need premium to skip those random songs thats keep popping up.,positive
It's a very good app but I'm searching a song and play completely different song ... it's annoying... please fix it.,negative
App is very very nice song,positive
"This app isnt worth it anymore, the most basic things for a music streaming service is stuck behind a damn pay wall, cant even choose your own music without paying and thats the most basic thing you should be able to do regardless, this is just a big money grab and theres tons of apps better then spotify now, even youtube music and thats something",negative
"Spotify is a such a good app for people that are willing to pay premium, the ones that don't...good luck with ads",positive
I like the app and the music's there are there's some music that isn't there but most of the ones I like are there but I hate that there's many ads after just 1 or 2 songs. Amazing app just sometimes to many ads,negative
Not a single song In app .....after update I couldn't find a single song .....all playlist are empty ...when I tried to play song it shows problem with internet connection ...I reinstalled it multiple times ....but problem is still there ....now I switched to Spotify mini ....it's much better than the original app ... please solve the problem with app as early as possible,negative
The app won't play the song I choose. The idea seems to be to annoy someone into buying the premium. Not gonna happen like that. App deleted.,negative
Love it with spotify felling happyðŸ¥°,positive
BEST MUSIC APP EVER,positive
Great variety of music and Podcast.,positive
I can't login back...i have tried the mail link and OTP..... please help me to login... Spotify customer care!!,negative
"It is the only app that consistently cannot handle Bluetooth earbuds on my current and previous phones. It skips, pauses, loses one earbud, lags, even with downloaded albums. Unenjoyable. Rarely it does it when connected to the car via Bluetooth.",negative
"Unable to login from android device from last one month. Tried reinstalling, clearing cache and everything.",negative
Best app for songs ðŸ’œ,positive
I hate it when they add random dumb songs to my playlist and I can't even remove them and the song I'm finding doesn't even pop up it's just random songs that I hate,negative
I'm happy and grateful cause all characteristics of songs that I research here I find it,positive
The songs are amazing,positive
Good music and update collection.,positive
this is the best music app ever. The ads only show up every now and and when they do it's only two or three ads.,positive
Awesome the best music I listened to every day with my work mates too great way to do a work out at the gym too,positive
Great listening experience.,positive
"The last update is too buggy. Every time I want to access the current playing song/podcast, I have to kill the app and reopen. Also, the apps sometimes dies in the middle of playing. It is a paid service and we expect more reliability. Also, you could have just rolled back to the tag of the previous version with a higher version code until you fix it. The app is such a pain to use now.",negative
Very good songs and sound quality,positive
The songs are amazing  ,positive
It was great to have something that works it was great to have something that works oh I said that twice,positive
"Great app, great content. Only reason I don't give it five stars is because when I set up a radio station, it often jumps to the next song instead of playing the first one all the way through. This happens when connected to a Bluetooth device. Also, podcast playback speed should be completely customizable. This is the BIGGEST reason I haven't made the jump from Google Podcasts to Spotify. I listen at 1.3 speed; 1.2 is too slow and 1.5 is way too fast.",negative
Most music when you want it,positive
Can't even listen to a song - it plays some random other songs it added to the playlist instead.,negative
"I've been using Spotify for several years and it played a fundamental role in how I consume and discover music since then. 10/10 . Also, the fact that more and more easy to use features (like swiping to queue songs) came to the android version makes me hope for an even brighter future with me and this app ðŸ˜Ž",positive
"It's showing that I'm not connected to internet. Believe me I have tried everything ..even I asked for help in customer care service provider of Spotify, they were giving me the casual ideas which I already knew ,bruhhh I came there cause I have done attempts already and you are a service provider , so dumb !!! Well,I tried to make new account too but same ,it's not working. I'm so done with Spotify.",negative
"My Spotify does not work if I use wifi it shows ads but doesn't let me choose the song to play as there is no ""internet connection"" I am not able to listen to my podcasts and am very dissatisfied with the app. I deleted the app and reinstalled it and now I can't even login. What a great app!",negative
The whole function of this app is best but any song should also be given an option to play next.,positive
"great experience, been using it for years!!",positive
Too many add but good to use,positive
"The ads that get played during podcasts has a bug. Sometimes you're able to fast forward the ads and the other times, the app crashes and your podcast restarts from the beginning. Then you have to try and remember where you were listening from. It's disappointing from a large app developer",negative
"Even though my account is PREMIUM, I have to turn on my data/wifi every now and then because my downloads are disappearing or unable to play when my phone is not online. What is the use of PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and having the OFFLINE MODE ""ON"" if I still need to go online every time I'll be using the app?? This has been going for months now. Same scenario with my cousin who is also on PREMIUM. If this continues, I will deactivate my subscription and uninstall the app. This is frustrating!",negative
I love the app and I even subscribe to premium but the latest updates caused some inconveniences. Why remove the fast scroll function on the right side of the screen. I believe there is no reason to completely remove a very useful function. The experience when browsing without fast scroll is horrible by having to swipe countless times in a playlist with over a thousand songs. The addition of quick access to search is quite nice but it defeats the purpose when it doesn't play the playlist.,negative
"Crashes and doesn't display music playing, needs restart",negative
Nice,positive
It must have updated or something because now I can't choose what song plays in my Playlists it's all just random and now there's ads. I was ranting thank you for reading.,negative
"I've been using Spotify for more than 3 years but since last 2 months, I couldn't buy premium. It always shows notification said ""unable to connect"". Please fix this. Thank you in advance",negative
I love this app and how I can find everything I want to listen to and the play lists made for me,positive
"#JRE is truly the only reason I use Spotify. Pretty good, you can find and listen to almost anything. Ads stink, especially the ads from Spotify trying to get me to pay for premium so I don't have to listen to ads.",negative
A lot of problems making suffer in this application,negative
Brought so much new music from similar taste. Definitely 5 stars!,positive
So far so good. Lots of music to choose from and even the good old stuff from the goth days back in the 80s,positive
Can listen to all my play lists and more,positive
"A must app. But payment issues in Nepal and can we download the lyrics please. Considering these minor things , Spotify is great app to listen to music",positive
Great music selections in any genre.,positive
"Just started wit Spotify, but like it very much, it's easy to use.",positive
Love the sound quality and that I can make my own playlist from it,positive
"Loved this app until I couldn't access all my liked songs. And when I pick a genre in the ""liked"" playlist it won't just play that category,in fact it won't play at all. Have to keep uninstalling",negative
"Horrible it installed itself by itself on my phone! Only I should authorize what gets on my phone, your invading my privacy n space. Logically ads try to get you to install but I didn't have any ads. Not see any ad for getting Spotify so how it landed on my phone is idk but our phones we think are ours when someone else thinks they're theirs, maybe bc of t&C's or names of phones, carriers etc",negative
Perfect and the best singing apps of all time..,positive
spotify is the best music app for djing to following other people can see playlist whatever they want and thank you using spotifly all times by using differant device for e.g Alexa,positive
New update and a new problem comes up!! Now i can't search for my playlists! Can't queue properly. Uninstalled and reinstalled and it's crashed three times on chromecast in 20 minutes! You guys really are total idiots. And now artists tracks are missing. Utterly useless.,negative
good,positive
"The shuffle function is not random. When I'm listening to music for a longer period of time, the same songs start coming back. My playlists are over 3000 songs long, so they haven't all been played. Every time I hit shuffle, some songs keep getting into ky queue over and over again, I'd like to listen to all my songs in my playlist, not the 50 Spotify decides I need to kisten to all the time...",negative
"I absolubtly hate how im trying to listen to a playlist ive created and spotify just desides to play suggested songs over and over and over and over i cant even listen to the music on my playlist because all of these bullsh*t songs that play one after another i want to enjoy my music without getting these god damned interuptions while listening, I dont have the money to get premium its just so annoying and im better off listening to music on youtube not youtube music just search it up on youtube",negative
"I love it, however I wish you didn't have to pay to be allowed to download songs. I wish it was a completely free app. I do love how it is set up and it is an easy app that allows you to listen to all your favorite songs. Just frustrating you can't access it fully without paying.",positive
"Glitchy and unacceptable. My Spotify has always been glitchy, closes at random, skips multiple songs, switched out of the playlist to a random one however now it's beyond bad. The play bar disappears constantly for days on end. This means I can't skip, pause add songs to playlist, pause podcasts, ect. I think this is absolutely unacceptable for a paid app. Yes I've force stopped the app, deleted and re download it.",negative
The app is always closing itself when it is put on background.. I have tried updating.. But it's not getting fixed.. Sometime Restarting the phone prevents it.. But still it closes itself,negative
Why i cant open my spotify apps,negative
"They have you pick some of your favorite artists, then they try to force you into buying a premium subscription by not playing your favorite artists.",negative
Varey nice daisy,positive
"It keeps going off when I lock my screen and the songs I'm listening to no longer show so I basically need to guess what I'm listening to, what a con",negative
"It's very good, i just don't like the ads that's why I'm giving 4/5âœ¨. As you see i m a broke person who has no penny left and to deal with those annoying ads in between of my emotional breakdown or personal concert session is just so frustratingðŸ¥².... Well, anyways enough of my melodrama, if you're a rich person with an obsession of musicðŸŽ¶ then you should try it. But at the end of the day it's your decision, still i m just stating my experience as Spotify was dying to know my pov/experience.ðŸ˜‚",negative
I have liked it a lot and i have dicided to give it 5 star. I was awsome and i really want to say a thank to the creator of this app Spotify,positive
My favorite way to listen to music and podcast,positive
"The spotify experience has been amazing so far, it's additional function (lyrics) included in each music/podcast played by users make life easy.",positive
Great app.all types of song are available here.in the playlist i have a problem.i cant find the song which i want to listen.please fix it.otherwise i love everything about this app.ThxðŸ‘,positive
Simply the best music app have ever come across with good sound system and one thing is can do something else on the phone while playing music unlike other appsðŸ™„ which will stop playing. Awesome!,positive
Good list of music all round.,positive
I'm unable to go online even though my connection is alright. It says in the app that i should go online and try again. Unable to play songs! Neither online or offline but I'm able to play podcast. This is so disappointing ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸. Why aren't you working on this. Utterly frustrated. App crashing repeatedly.,negative
"It's really good, I really liked the music. However, you need a pretty good connection for it to work, and my house was not good enough, so I ended up having to use my personal data. But it didn't use a lot of data, and I was on it for hours at a time.",negative
Many music So 5 stars,positive
"REALLY, 5 ads after each song? I'm pissed off. Until you fix this I'm going to change my rate.",negative

Cannot fault Spotify. ðŸ’š,positive

Lied about the 30 minutes of ad free music thing,negative
Nice music app thank you spotify.,positive
"Spotify still hasn't been fixed, huh?",negative
This is best music app which song I want to search from YouTube now I search form Spotify the best thing is this I can listen every BTS song so that ðŸ¥°,positive
"Spotify never downloads the whole of my downloaded playlist, so I end up having to use my own data or only listen to a couple of songs. Especially frustrating when running. Also it is never consistent about how podcast episodes are sorted - I'd like to be able to filter out played episodes with the newest episode at the top by default, but that isn't possible. I pay student price at the moment, and when that ends I don't plan on paying full price - I expect better functionality for my money.",negative
Hey you guys love you all Like seriously...work is stressful for everyone...everywhere....but you guys...that Playlist u make for us...are so thoughtful...you all make my day better...I love you Spotify team â¤ ðŸ’– ðŸ’• ðŸ˜˜ ðŸ’— â™¥,positive
not for listen songs just see advertisentsðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,negative
"Generally good algorithm-generated playlists, but can be too repetitive across multiple mixes at times. Podcast UX is terrible. Not being able to sort downloaded podcasts by date published is infuriating, and having old episodes randomly show up in the queue is incredibly annoying. Having to delete downloaded episodes and remove them individually from the 'my episodes' list is the definition of tedium. I've stopped listening to Spotify exclusives because it's just not worth the pain.",negative
Please spotify i love the app but i have a pc and a Phone and my to acounts are linked i can skip any time i want but on my fone i can only skip 6 times and lets sal i want to click on a song then i cant listen to that specifik one then there is other songs playing then the one i want to listen come on because i cant click on it put on pc i can pls fix it,negative

Sucks always buffering and it eats up my data unlike Pandora. Fast forward to song in the middle of the song I'm listening to.,positive
Very goodðŸ¤› ExcellentðŸ‘Œ in sound quality And so impressive in song shuffling What a brilliant platform like Spotify âœ…,positive
Awesome app,positive
It keeps buting random songs in my playlists and in the songs i like,negative
"The app itself is easy to navigate. While I do believe in free speech, I believe that what people say will have consequences, good or bad, and JR's past use of a racial slur means I will not lend support to him or any service that affiliates with him. Him saying the N word and simply getting a slap on the wrist is not setting a good example for people. We need to make it clear that in the present and the future racist speech and/or behavior will get you at the very least cancelled.",negative
This app is amazing for music and its feature the podcasts . OP app ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©,positive
It won't play anything off my play list ot plays what Spotify wants.,negative
"It works ok, but a has a surprisingly large number of random bugs. Can't use library offline at times. Skipping songs prevents alternating songs from playing. Long load times of downloaded songs. Has large library of songs available, so there's that",negative
"I LOVE this app!! It's a great music app. And for Spotify premium, well it's cheap and reasonable! I have no problems with this app whatsoever! Except there's one problem. Every single song I play, there's always a ad in the middle of it. sure premium will help, but I think Spotify could do a bit better on that. overall AMAZING app!!",positive
"removed the option to play samples when adding new music to playlists, this makes ot so awkward and genuinely annoying to make playlists now",negative
My Spotify keeps cutting out and stopping since the update!,negative
"It used to be good then they did this stupid update,like seriously 6 skips per hour and you can't skip forward in songs anymore.",negative
It's wonderful that I can listen to music I like with my playlist and put it on loop too,positive
My clients absolutely love my Playlist that I provide through your app so they can listen to music while they are getting their hair done. They love the selections and quality of music that is provided thru spotify,positive
"You should be able to have collaborative Playlists that only certain people can edit but anyone can see. It's annoying that if I want to have a collaborative Playlist, I have to be careful with whom I share it with so they do not edit it. Needs permissions for certain user levels for editing, viewing etc",negative
"Its good but it's not showing lyrics on my phone, please fix it",negative
I can't copy any links to share songs.,negative
Good options on various kind of music,positive
Easy to use. Much better than YouTube.,negative
This new update causes music to stop playing randomly or start playing with now way to pause it but close the app. Takes out the enjoyment of listening with no interruptions on a paid subscription.,negative
I love that I can see all my favorites and much more,positive
"App is terrible, the ""now playing"" feature constantly glitches out and won't work. Causes you to have to hit play every 10 minutes or so. Or restart your phone before using everyday if not multiple times. Tried dealing with customer support and that was equally frustrating. Note that this is not a phone issue, it is brand new and updated. Looking at switching to a different service.",negative
You can't play the music you want if you are on free mode because of the shuffle,negative
Generally an okay app. I have premium and keep experiencing connection issues when trying to cast onto my playstation. Not sure if it's a problem associated with the new update.,positive
Love it,positive
"Easy to use and very good app never had a problem ,it shows some song lyrics but not all",positive
Nice work ,positive
This is the best music app ever. This is the one to rule them all. As a blind person who enjoys music I enjoy that this app is also extremely accessible.,positive
Awful. Unable to play playlist in order unless on premium version. Less useful than a sunroof on a submarine.,negative
Luv listening to music. Spotify is the best,positive
"The songs are annoying asf, I can't even listen to ads bcs of these stupid songs. 2/5 star. Shame on you Spotify.",negative
The UI while I'm in the car is so frustrating. The car thing isn't available in my country. I can't actually manage music anymore.,negative
Please do include a button for download. Very important,positive
Love the music choices. Easy to use.,positive
Unable to play videos of Joe Rogan podcast. It says use the video icon but I don't have a video icon!,negative
After few latest updates it has become really impossible to listen to the song we actually want to hear it just randomly takes to some song and can't play full songs in favorite playlist like previously in non subscription mode,negative
It plays music. No need to elaborate,positive
Very good,positive
Who ever developed the feature for others to use MY speaker automatically. I hope you get fired and have a horrid life. Especially after I've turned off your stupid feature and then today I open up to a notification that some moron turned it back on for me as if it was a good thing for me. I sincerely hope the person who made this a feature boils from the inside out.,negative
Great podcast section,positive
"It's an amazing app to listen to music and podcasts, and I use it all the time! There are barely no adds, and it's the best free music app ever.",positive
just has everything I could ever want in music including the words to songs if I want them I love my Paul Simon so much and can hear everything he ever wrote inone long stream,positive
Always a Great play list!,positive
"Great music listening app. It can be buggy from time to time, but I've had issues for awhile. Video/podcast interface could better. Like have audio only mode, and scheduled downloads for new episodes.",negative
Spotify is great but sometimes the ads are iritating,negative
"Great for.music and stuff, just wish you could pock a single song and that it wasn't on shuffle the whole time to make it free, other than that I've got no problems",positive
Listen everyday. Great music selection,positive
"I used to love this app. It's great on my TV, but terrible on my phone now. It takes forever to load, then even longer to play about 10 seconds before it freezes for like 12... just frustrating now. Please fix this!!! ... a year later and it still does this",negative
"Great Stufft It's, my kind of music so far keep rocking.",positive
eff you spotify,positive
It makes me living more then listening,positive
"Fun fact; when I tap on a song, it's because I want to listen to THAT song. Other fun fact, when I tap on a Playlist, it's because I want to listen to songs from THAT playlist. The fact that I have to pay for very simple functions like that is really dumb. :/ Even Youtube gets that right. Also, the ads are repetitive.",negative
Was w great app initially but the app get more unstable with every update .for one music in playlists will play but directly clicking song in the search bar will not that is if the search function even works at all .its sad that now the app wont work will sadly have to cancel my subscription and use soundizz to export my playlists,negative
"Skips through podcast episodes after ads is most annoying, other issues make it very hard to enjoy my favorite podcast but its only place i can listen",negative
"Just because I'm not buying premium, doesn't mean you give me 5 ads in a row every 3-4 songs. Also, whilst on mobile you can't pick which song you'd like to listen to. Not to mention that the ads sometimes get ""stuck"" and won't let you skip them. When I play my playlist, it starts off with a couple songs from the list, then randomly starts playing songs I've never heard of, which definitely aren't on my playlist. Removing features from non-premium members is a great way to get a 1 star review",positive
"One song, 3-4 adds. It forces you to buy premium.",positive
Unbelievable what you get for free. My fav app,negative
Sooo many issues with this app and no customer support whatsoever do not pay for this! Many users complain about spotify canceling accounts in order to spread false news... like twitter. Xbox app hasnt worked right for over a year now!!!!! Does not play videos the screen just goes black have to keep closing and reopening and eventually maybe it may play... also get playback notifications when app is shut down and not even running. Watch they'll suggest I contact customer support who does nothing,negative
"It's great in my opinion. Cheap monthly bill. Even so, music and podcasts are free. Can't beat that!",positive
"Nice app, soft, easy to use",positive
Easy to use and has a bunch of variety. Love this app.,positive
"Advertising is terrible on this app. I am not joking when I say that I heard AT LEAST 6 advertisements in 10 minutes. Heard 3, music finally started playing at 10:17. Then at 10:25, 3 more started playing. Are you kidding me??? That is an insane amount of advertising. The only media I've ever been on that has more frequent advertisements is Snapchat and those are like 5 seconds long. I've certainly considered either buying a subscription or completely leaving this app for a better streaming app.",negative
"The option to skip, pause, and see what's playing is not even shown. Have to close the app just to get the music to stop.",negative
Music selection is A to Z. Any country Any artist,positive
"Great app, just wish would allow a like or dislike on recommended songs so the same ones don't keep reappearing.",negative
"I don't understand why I'm paying for a premium plan for an app that I constantly have to delete and re-install at least 3 times a week. The app will let me press the play button, but it doesn't let press pause or skip or anything else. Fix this!",negative
Its very hard to listen to the songs you like since spotifY KEEP ADDING MUSIC YOU DONT LIKE INTO YOUR PLAYLISTS AND EVEN PLAYING 1 SONG CAN AUTOMATICALLY ADD ANOTHER SONG FOR NO REASON,negative
The update is terrible. Keeps closing on me and turns the music down at random times.,negative
I love Spotify!!!!! Still loving it!!!ðŸŽ¶,positive
"Really good selection and the ads aren't that bad , I actually get a lot of candy ads n and up buying reese's lol ! I'm enjoying using it at home outside doing yardwork, keep carrying Joe Rogan, and small artists like The Sober Junkie And Whiteloaf .",positive
You can find almost any song on this app it has helped me through some tough times too.. So if u see this review download/install Spotify,negative
My Daily Energizer ,positive
I love Spotify I got it today and I have had all music playing on YouTube so when I found out I download in seconds,positive
The functionality of the app is acceptable the way Spotify abuses artists is deplorable. I wouldn't use this but Spotify and others make it almost impossible to access music in any other format.,negative
I really like this app and can listen to any kind of music I want or any language and helps me even when writing my notes I listen to music and write as much as I can without getting bored,positive
"Its good but when u want to play a song , they give other songs yo listen to instaed of the song and sometimes when u trying to get to the song the skips are limited .It has the same effect on the playlist u cant enjoy ur song without other songs interfering and eepecially adding songs u dont like to ur playlist",positive
"I dealt with issues for over 6 months, contacted support numerous times. I had the app limited to only 5 songs at a time, when that got fixed after several months the app proceeded to crash and randomly stop playing, then it would just randomly play in my pocket with the app in the background. Asked for some money back for all the time I couldn't use the app and they offered to refund one month and put me on a free account. 6 months of bs? Have $10 and ads. YouTube Red just got another user",negative
Brilliant,positive
Very good app my first time are using this app are most very experienced in my feature,positive
Overall a great music app. My only issue is the hassle one have to go through just to download a song. It should be a single tap process but spoti6makes it longer than it needs to be.,negative
The amount of bugs and glitches is scandalous for a paid app....close to unsubscribing at this stage...,negative
It reduces my storage to be fully songs that I can make a playlist n play it online ðŸ’¯,negative
"i love spotify to death and have used it since early 2018. I have had premium for a while and overall its a good app. however, for some reason the newest update made it all weird. my biggest problem is the previews, or lack thereof. whenever I press ""add songs"" on a playlist, normally theres a list of songs and you can play a short preview of them. thats like my favorite feature, I don't fully have to listen to a song which is nice. but for some reason its been removed? please fix this ðŸ™ðŸ™",negative
Great app find all songs i like and new ones but tired of being double charged for the premium package about to uninstall,negative
Nice app but can be really annoying on mobile consideringthe fact that you can't arrange or change the order of how the songs play in a playlist so you just have to listen to whatever song it chooses to have first,negative
Great app. Couldn't do without it.,positive
"Too many ads, and it plays louder thsn what you are listening to.",negative
It's pretty good but most of the time it doesn't have almost all the song in it so far as I can tell but still good,positive
my spotify is not working,negative
"Decent but......this app has potential to be great BUT the podcasts stop on every single podcast out of the blue, I have to keep manually hitting play which is not feasible to working in a clean room and not being able to touch your device. Please fix. Also, it'll play podcasts I've previously listened to and deleted randomly. Annoying!!!!",negative
If Spotify doesn't fix the playlists i will start to bring old tablet to school so i can have control over what plays and when.,negative
"Been using for years now, but recently Spotify has decided to stop working and not allowing me to listen to any music end off, even after following info online, logging in and out, clearing my cache, reinstalling the app, I've even reset my phone and still nothing.. And I've had no more ideas... any ideas so I can attempt to fix? Spotify helps me with personal issues. Spotify is online but it says all my playlist are empty and do not show up on my library.",negative
"So nice for playing songs you actually want to listen to <3 Difficult to play when trying to play spedific songs on a mobile device, however it works fine with specific songs on my computer.",positive
Wonderful variety of music is excellent,positive
"The app posts pro-US war propaganda in something called the ""information hub"" telling me to support the US military and allies. I used to live in a refugee building with people who had families killed and homes destroyed by the US, including children. I think it's stupid for a music app to support violence and jingoism.",negative
"Spotify is a decent app, but WHY ARE THERE SO MANY ADS?! I get an ad after EVERY SONG, and after a while, it gets very annoying",negative
i want to replay my songs,positive
Says you don't get ads for 30 minutes if you watch one set of ads at the start of listening. 2 songs later you get an ad.,negative
Agree with the people complaining about the music suddenly stopping. I tried everything and it's still doing it. It's so annoying! I am a paying member but am paying for something I can't use.,negative
App crashed when going horizontal while watching a podcast.,negative
"I enjoy using Spotify to listen to my podcasts. It has a much better user interface than Google Podcasts. Listening to podcasts on Spotify is free, which is really good.",positive
Free users be warned not to use all your skips Spotify Will make u listen to songs that 'they' want you too listen too... Uve been warned lol,negative
The skipping limit is a dumb paywall. But I enjoy using it on my console â˜ â˜ ,positive
****PLZZZ****FIX****THIS*****GLITCH****** PROBLEM!****** This app hasn't been working right at all! It's irritating me that I can't listen to my music. It plays a song then stops right after it starts. And then it says it's playing but it's not really playing. Idk what's going on but yall need to fix it.,negative

If I could give them a negative five I would I tried to cancel the premium service before the subscription was up and they still charge me after I hadn't used it for a whole week after subscription was over. When I talk to chat they told me that they closed my account but then my account was charged a second time and I still have premium service that I do not want and I'm paying for and I do not use it,negative
I've found so many new artists and favorites! Love this app,positive
"I guess this app is good. My problems with it is that it has a lot of adds for me and when I pick a specific song, I just get ""recommendations"". I just want to hear my music that I want without recommendations in peace!",negative
"The app is lagging continuously, which is quite annoying. Right now, every time I open the app, i can play music but don't see the bar at the bottom, same when I go to my home screen. I need to open it a few more times before it appears, and it's getting on my nerves.",negative
"It's impossible to click on one particular song. It's also impossible to create a playlist, without Spotify messing it up. I have no clue, why anyone would use the app. Tenecent is also invested in Spotify, and that means, that all collected data, is being passed on to the chinese government. Not just your taste in music, but also EVERYTHING else, you do on your phone. Due to chinese laws, there is no need for you to consent to this. DO NOT USE SPOTIFY!!!",negative
"Despite the junk out there, there's still just nothing as good as a quality app, UI and massive collection of music than this one. I went back to another brand for a few months and found myself wishing they had the swapping mechanism and variety Spotify has and have just come back.",negative
I like it,positive
I get ads very two songs it's so annoying,negative
"After Switching to Night mode there are issues in play & Pause option. Sometimes It shows Unable to share the songs it also unable to copy Link of Song, Command of Something went wrong Appears. Song Collection is Great",negative

Sooooo many ads,negative
Best music experience ever,positive
"Keeps asking to allow Bluetooth every time I open the app. I don't need Spotify that much, if its going to start getting annoying with all these messages I'll just cancel my sub and uninstall",negative
Best music app ever found. Just hats off to this app. But only one think I didn't find right. That after we add songs to our created playlists it didn't show the total number of songs in it. So please make a option where it shows total songs in the playlist. Otherwise the app is excellent. ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜Œ,positive
It sucks ðŸ˜•. It will erase all of your music that you have. And when you try to put your music back on it will erase it again.,negative
Back-to-back no commercials not YouTube and not nothing better than this,negative
this is free music with hardly any time having ads but when you do get ads there are at least 2 ads that aren't skippable but its worth it five out of five spotify if you see this review I just want to say thank you for it not having to be paid for,positive
App quite working after last Samsung update on 5-13-22. Not happy had all my music with you and have nothing yet. Before this I have been very happy andno thinking of upgrading. But if I can't depend on you I will have to look elsewhere.,negative
Peak app with peak music and good with premium dont know about non-premium ,positive
"Absolutely great, would be even better if more obscure stuff were on it. Also surprised that random albums by some artists aren't featured. Could also use more mixed stuff (djs etc). Playlists are awesome though.",positive
"I listen almost exclusively to sports podcasts, and the app constantly stops streaming when an ad pops up on the app screen, even when the app is only playing in the background. I'm moving back to Podbean.",negative
It is good i like this app i love listening to music and I loved it,positive
It needs to work offline ðŸ˜’,negative
Good service but bad app. The current playing bar keeps getting lost.Had to logout and login couple of times.,negative
"My app keeps crashing every half an hour or so. Re-installed the app, cleared the cache, wrote in multiple complaints to SpotifyCares on Twitter for more than 9 days. The response is the same - we are looking into it. The problem still persists - not what I expect for a Premium Service that I'm paying for.",negative
I love this spotify app but the adds are more,positive
When u open data connection then your mobile balance will disappear,negative

Update the style music selection keeps gltiching out and making me mad,negative
Great Absolutely satisfied with Spotify.,positive
"Spotify is awsome, i flund all my fav songs to listen to, but recently my spotify has been glitching and not playing my entire playlist and its making me kinda annoyed but itd still a very good music/podcast app",positive

"Spotify can bug out sometimes even with prime and your supposed to be able to listen to downloaded songs, 1/3 it doesn't play any of my songs offline even when I absolutely know they've been downloaded but it's pretty good besides that and a couple of other minor things",positive
Love the music just wish you could replay songs after song has finished,positive
I love this app. The only problem is there no way to download songs. The whole reason I wanted a music is to listen on the road if going on long trip. But i cant listen offline. And i am not going $120 a year to listen offline! Plz fix this. This app is my favorite to navigate. Plz read this.,positive
"It was a good experience, however after updating the apps 1 day ago, the performance is worst. When I listen songs and podcast it randomly stops itself.. I know am using free version,but it doesn't mean the performance will slow. Not many people can afford premium.",negative
Please bring back the preview option. Also too many ads,negative
Good,positive
Best music experience ever,positive
How the hell do you keep this dog water app from auto playing once it connects to a device?,negative
"I have been a user for a very long time. Once I switched to Spotify, it changed the way I listened to music and podcast. Anything I can think of, I've been able to find it. And with all the made for you mixes I'm able to discover new music and artist all the time. The only down fall is this app. It crashes, pauses what you're listening to randomly on its own, and the currently playing screen is no where to be seen. And this has been happening for months. Now it won't connect to my speakers.",negative
This is the best app that I have ever seen and listening to music from this app is an good experience,positive
Great Music App.,positive

Im trynna listen to music (not ads).,negative
"Probably the best music and podcast streaming app. With minor issues and bugs. I trust the team, they are and will be fixing the problems.",positive
"Everything with the app is ok, except the ad thing. At first they will not show many ads to keep the people believing it's good.but gradually . The most irritating part comes. I have almost studied all the ads audio , because it's repeating forever. It's too much. They are doing this to us to be their premium customer. So we have to pay for it. But what if poor people wants to listen without interruption? At first app was fine but now the most hated app is this,u people better download ytmusic.",negative
It can create playlist and add downloaded songs to playlists and there is a button where you get free premium no credit card needed for 4 months,negative
This app was amazing for songsðŸ¤ŸðŸ¤ŸðŸ¤ŸðŸ¤Ÿ,positive
"Great service, always has the songs and podcasts I would want to listen to.",positive

"4 years sub. Love it. Just wished they had mixtapes, and some songs I can't find on here that are on YouTube.",negative
"It hasn't worked for the past two months, even after uninstalling it and downloading again. It shows albums and playlists, but every single one says it's empty. I gave it time to see if they would fix it, but two months of having no music on a music app is pathetic. Apparently it's a known issue for Androids and if reinstalling it doesn't work they say you're out of luck.",negative
Everything is good about this app.. Especially the dedicated playlists thing but the extremely frequent ads are such a headache.. Not everyone all the time can afford a premium subscription so please be a little understanding and don't line up ads more than songs...,negative
"Thing i really hate that when i try to listen to a song there's always like 10 random songs, and i can't even Skip all of them, like please just let me listen to the song ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸",positive

"When i use my smartwatch to control spotify, the app either becomes very jumpy (playing is jumpy,or stop playing altogether) or the simply quitted from my phone. Even when music continues to play, the app interface does not display properly on my phone at (even within the app, it doesnt display the currently-playing status). It has been going on for a while and no fixing so far. Now I simply wont use spotify on my smartwatch! Please fix it or I am forced to switch music provider. Thanks.",negative
If you like music just download Spotify it's literally one of if not the best for listening to music,positive

Again, it's super slow, especially when I open it on the bus, I have to wait 10 mins before it works. With everything I pay every month this is unacceptable, so please fix",negative
Allows you to find singers and music you wouldn't normally listen to or have found,positive
"About a month or so ago started to get a bit glitchy. Sounds a bit like a CD skipping and freezing about every 15 to 20 minutes. Really annoying, sometimes freezes for minutes at a time.",negative
"This app plays so many great songs and albums of all different types from reggae, rock, soul, mellow, oldies, rap, heavy metal, hip-hop, new artists, acoustic and on and on... You can pick and choose them yourself and it's free but there's ads. If you get premium then you don't have to deal with that annoyance and interruption of music but it will cost you on a monthly basis. You can also listen to the music with the songs ðŸŽµ lyrics which is a great feature so you can sing along!",positive
"Since Samsung has updated, Spotify is not working properly",negative
Great discovery All my favorite tunes listened at leisure. Doesn't seem to be available offline though. Tried downloading but files not found saved anywhere.,positive

"I have been Spotify user for about 5 years now. I love the application on desktop and web but the mobile app is where it gets the 3 stars. ""Car View"" was a feature that existed up until 2021 where it was ultimately removed in November. This was a SIGNIFICANT FEATURE for users without the newer car play and android auto. This feature single handedly improved safety when driving as the buttons were big enough to press. This was not a good change.",negative
Nice,positive
Theres this glitch were the play bar gets removed so i have to keep uninstalling and installing this god dam app,negative

Just fix the connectivity issue! I don't know what causes the connection to break in the app but it doesn't have to do anything with the network signal while using mobile data. Kindly fix the same at the earliest.,negative
I've always loved Spotify! The $10 a month is worth it to me since I listen to music pretty much all day every day. Being able to download music offline too is also nice especially when driving in areas that don't have good signal. Been using it for years and I definitely recommend it.,positive
It good but to repeat ur favorite u have it get premium,negative
Bc of the advertisement all ways ruing my mood,negative

I'm Spotify premium user. I love to listen on Spotify. But I'm quite disappointed that Spotify doesn't show lyrics of the song. Not even if i am listening it online. Spotify must have this feature as it a world class online music platform.,negative
Crashes when I try to play any podcast but plays music tracks just fine. Very weird. Just started happening today 6/10/22,positive
I am very disappointed and unhappy the podcast feature is still available in Pakistan I am waiting for that feature from 1 year but I am always disappointed by Spotify I am not able to listen to podcast in my country it's been 2 years since it has been released in Pakistan but still they did not fixed the issue. I am very unhappy I think the developer should be ashamed because they are not able to solve this little problem. I think they don't even want to fix it. I am uninstalling Spotify,negative
It's amazing always entertaining. ....but i need spotify to remove ads while listening music's it sometimes ruins mood overall it's an good app.,positive
Honestly this app is more than amazing. And I have been loving it a lot since I got premium. One of the best app UI's I have seen. I am waiting for Canvas and Hi-Fi to release in india.,positive

Installed the app but after a few days of dealing with it activating whenever it wants to I uninstalled it. Apparently the issue has been around since at least 2019 and still hasn't been fixed.,negative
Spotify is my main sorts for music! The only issue I have is that it keeps playing the same songs over and over sometimes. But other then that I love Spotify.,negative
Unlimited music choices.,positive
I have been using this app from very long time but suddenly it's not playing any song and showing all the playlists empty. Tried reinstalling it as well but nothing works still facing the same issue.,negative
Really good for all your favorites but Spotify's suggestions have really widened my listening range. Both thumbs up.,positive
Very good app. But i pay for Spotify premium and podcasts tend to run their own ads on the show. Spotify need to find a way of stopping that for premium users. Or cutting it out of our podcasts.,negative
Ads are annoying and shuffle play is too but it still works regardlessly so it's a good app for music.,positive
"Spotify is either reading my brain waves or straight up eavesdropping on my conversations. Way before I opened the app, my school played here comes the sun in the speakers, and that's what Spotify played, and this same thing has happened multiple times. Bruh, just quit and set up an option at least. Thieves.",negative
Greatest music app was listening to linking park and prokid,positive

Got this app about 3 weeks ago and it's been great haven't had any major issues just the app crashed 2 or 3 times but after I re-loaded it it worked perfectly fine.,positive
"Great app with amazing recommendations, but I wish there was an option to play the song you clicked on without it being a premium feature specific to only mobile users",negative
"I use Spotify Premium, and it's great value for money. Spotify has a diverse range of curated playlists, making it easy for you to find the musical genres that you enjoy. It's also clever enough to make playlists designed just for you, based on what you typically listen to. It has never been easier for me to discover new artists and songs that I love!",positive
App doesn't open. Shows no internet connection when I'm running on net that plays youtube videos at 1080 without buffering. 3 ads after every 2 songs. Lots of data and battery usage.,negative
"App frequently glitches and crashes, and even paying for premium you get ads on podcasts.",negative
So much of adds Cant listen songs peacefully Best thing is i can listen to bts songs,positive
Very pleased with Spotify so far,positive
"I tried YouTube Music, Gaana, Jiosaavn and Wynk Music but came on a final verdict that Spotify is unbeatable.",negative
My listening at my speed and preferences! I appreciate how much freedom I have to enjoy music from all over the world ans hours of podcasts as well as holistic tools.,positive
"Please fix that your app is not remembering that I want to have in my library only ""downloaded"" category active. I think I will change music app because your app is getting worse and worse!",negative
This app is fine everywhere but casting. It screws right up and just keeps skipping the songs forward with not even a second between skips,negative
It keeps stealing the audio focus from podcast addict and gets stuck playing music until I force stop it . Started around the time of most recent update.,negative
I love easy to use good music,positive
"Spotify's recent update has made it impossible to manage whatever I'm playing. There isn't a player at the bottom of the app, and the player widget also isn't working. In order to pause what I'm playing, I need to do a hard close of the app. In order to keep playing, I need to open the app and navigate to what I was trying to play. Edited to add: also, the playback on the app stops 5x/hour.",negative
Add,positive
Pay a subscription to not have ads and now I get ads!! Absolute joke!,negative
Very music playlists make the app...and listen too enjoyed,positive
The control panel for the song won't show so I'm unable to pause/play next/previous my songs and have no control except clicking on songs. Fix this.,negative

Love it you can find all type of music.,positive
All the music i can and want to listen to.,positive
Pretty much great. Some bugs could we addressed and even larger song selection.,positive
"App doesn't show playing now, need to restart it but it not 100% solution. Sometimes stops playing by itself. It started last month, 5 previous years of subscription were good, app worked fine.",positive
"Great streaming radio, documentary and artist albums.",positive
"I have been using the app since 5 years now, and frankly, it is a good app. But these days there are many problems with the app. Though I have purchased the premium package, I am not able to listen to the songs I want, or search for any song. It says something went wrong, or no internet connection. I waited for more than a year for the issue to get fixed. If this continues, I dont think I will renew my premium package anymore. There is no point since I cant listen to any songs.",negative
"Since last update there is a Bug with the 'now playing' screen and controls missing on samsungs. I cannot do the basics anymore: stop a song or skip to the next until I restart the app completely. Please fix, and get rid of all the unnecessary features and banners on Bluetooth.",negative
"It doesnt let me hear more than 5 sec of a song on my phone, but on my pc yes..... I Uninstaller, cleared cache , restarted my phone like 5 times and nothing",negative
"Was reading some reviews and im quite disapointed, so many complains about skiping or ads or songs added to a playlist, please upgrade to premium. The COMPANY and the ARTISTS are not making any money from free accounts, and then you hear most complains from these individuals, if you cant afford it yet pls dont give 1 to 2 stars to an app that you are freeloading from. Our plan is spot family, P214($3.8) for 6 fam members, that is P36 ea person/ month. Doesnt even dent ur monthly income friends",negative
"I love Spotify aside from the fact that random people join collaborative playlists now and they seem to refuse to believe this or do anything about it. There also isn't a feature to report random people for joining your playlist and adding songs by their band as promotion and deleting your songs. This has become a real problem that Spotify refuses to address and instead they claim no one should be able to join without the link, when they clearly are.",negative
"I have no listening controls more often than not. I would listen all day if it wasn't entirely infuriating. Get it together, Spotify. It doesn't seem like a difficult issue.",negative
"Only downloaded for Joe Rogan. Joke's on me, Spotify interface is so awkward to use, that I can't be bothered with it and I stopped listening to Joe Rogan. Thanks a bunch, Spotify!",negative
Please fix the bug that shuffles the song i want to hear whenever i play a song or go in my playlist liked song it always shuffles please fix it. Other than that I don't think there is a big issue. Thankyou.,negative

Just stoped working with my entertainment center and is super buggy.,negative
Experiencing issues while searching for a song sometimes. It shows no internet connection even if i am connected to one. This is very annoying. Fix this,negative
The app is just bad. Glitchy and unintuitive and has been for a decade. Good luck if you like podcasts.,negative
I mean i like this app its got all the music i need and want but there are just tooo many adds there are sometimes like 2 adds together i dont even listen to 4 songs and there are 7 adds it is gravely frustrating plz fix this.... but other than that this app is great....,positive
"garbage app, i literally can't subscribe to premium, every time i try to click the ""send pin"" it just says ""oops, something went wrong, please try again or contact our support team"", i tried to subscribe on my laptop, used incognito mode, restarted my phone, used a different browser but nothing worked. I'll just stick with YouTube music.",negative
Only app worth writing a review for. Almost perfect. Now provide a visualizer for Playstation and Xbox...please.,positive

I like how it gets my preferences and runs them very well. Great for anyday,positive
I love Spotifymusic and podcasts I get listen to the best music,positive
"Free, wiiiide variety of things to listen to, classical, odd, vintage modern and alternative. Some self published not so flash. And my favourite by far are the podcasts. Can be very glitch at times",negative
Grbage app. Never saves my place with podcasts. Constantly glitches. Many better music streaming services and podcast services. Can't wait for Last Podcast on the Left to leave so i can uninstall this trash.,negative
Problems with WiFi in android tablet- requires constant restart of the app,negative

Very gooD,positive
Great music selection,positive
Thanks Spotify. Amazing experience,positive
"Worst experience, automatic advertisements play suddenly even if you you are not playing any song, merely installed went to office and it plays advertisements automatically. Doesnt even show the playing advertisement in apps runing section. Really worst app... Recommend everyone to uninstall.",negative
Spotify is my life line. I love this app I use it every single day.,positive
Spotify is awesome !!!,positive
App is rubbish constantly stops playing. No play bar for over a week. Awful app.,negative
"Loved Spotify premium when I had it, but as soon as I couldn't afford it I was booted to free Spotify, and I never realized how absolutely awful it is. Limited skips and the inability to pick a song or make a queue is maddening. As someone with ADHD, I need this ability because I often need specific songs for certain activities. But no, that is now impossible because I am poor. Thanks for making me feel worse about it, Spotify.",negative
"Very nice music app with almost all music I know on it. Easy to make playlists and share music. Only too bad you cannot orden your playlists very efficiently. I listen to a lot of different genres and I have about 30+ playlists, which I cannot arrange top to bottom. Also showing your account to other spotify users, or accessing others accounts is a bit confusing but not entirely impossible, however, anyone who visits your account will initially only see your last 3 playlists. no clue why........",negative
My Playlist are gone. I click on one song and another one plays,negative
"Please, make it possible to select the content of the main page. Podcasts, fresh releases and recently listened tracks are higher than the daily mix. It's not right",negative
"Love this app, would give it 4 or 5 stars, but currently it's broken, saying I'm offline and need to go online to play anything not downloaded (im on wifi). Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but now I can't even log in, it's telling me to ""check my connection and try again"" (...still on wifi...). Everything else on my phone is working fine. I'll change my rating once this is fixed.",negative
"Hiding a song in release radar doesn't auto skip to the next track. When you skip manually, the app skips 2 songs ahead. Super dumb and annoying.",negative
"Terrible experience onmy S10+. Keeps cutting out, and when it does play, the now playing widget is nowhere to be seen in-app Update: I upgraded to the Samsung S22+ and the issue persists. The pulldown widget stops functioning before the audio cuts out, and it just says ""Spotify is Trying to Play""",negative
I'm a believer. I LOVE Spotify playlists!,positive
"I am so annoyed by the fact that I was listening to my playlist and some random music suddenly appear, I did never search of that music nor add it to any of my playlist, is so annoying I really wish this bug get fix as soon as possible because it annoyed me a lot I mean a lot. Is a shame Spotify did not fix it",negative
"Recent update BROKE Spotify on my phone, not happy about it I stream music CONSTANTLY, I've had Spotify premium for YEARS. I rely on this app to listen to music all day, and night cause I literally can't sleep without it, so it's EXTREMELY frustrating to me that now the app randomly doesn't show the ""Now Playing"" bar at the bottom of the screen, meaning I can't access the music player controls without restarting the app constantly Also music also now cuts out randomly & app crashes, PLEASE FIX!!",negative
Best music app in the world.,positive
Latest update is buggy. App crashes but still plays. Can't advance songs. I have to keep restarting app. Also can't control on Android auto in the car either. Please fix.,negative
"I had given it one star but increased to 4 cause the songs no longer pause randomly, and the curated playlists and song recommendations are amazing. I'd give it 5 stars if the sound improved.",positive
More ads on Spotify,negative
Too many ads,negative
"While I hear the premium version is good, the free version is really buggy for music. Specifically regarding the ads they use to support it. I've been using this on and off for years and I always have to stop after a few weeks, because of a bug that causes an advertisement to play on loop until the next update(which only stops the problem for roughly 2 weeks before it starts again). I've also reduced its score because of how poorly it compensates creators",negative
"Bring back the feature where, when I select podcasts in my library, each show is listed in order of most recently updated and has a subtitle saying when it was updated. Knowing if an episode came out today or yesterday is useful information, most podcasts drop different types of episodes on different days. Please stop removing useful features for no apparent reason. Still buggy, every time they patch something, something else starts acting weird. Again having premium makes no difference.",negative
best music app I've had...they have all the songs from each genre that i like to listen to and new songs that I enjoy!,positive
Actually I'd give it a 5 star but there's a big problem. 3 months ago when I updated this app and tried to play any song none of the songs were playing. And if I tried to search anything after that it buffers. This again happened yesterday again. IDK what type of problem is this 'cause Spotify still runs smoothly in my pc and my dad and mom's phone and also the lite version works perfectly in my phone. Please Spotify give me solution to fix this issue. My phone is running on android 8.1,negative
It's alright best to get a subscription to enjoy all features. It's still good when free too.,positive
Best music streaming out there,positive

"Only thing I would change is when I make a file of songs, don't put in suggestions. I made that file to listen to the songs I chose.",negative
"I was skeptical at first since I've had YouTube music forever, but after I switched over to Spotify everything was seamlessly easy. From the navigation of the app to creating my lists, I was able to get all of my music and then some back. So great job y'all.",positive
"They still continue to screw up accounts, and suck out downloaded songs on a daily basis. Leave my downloads the F-alone. It's why I pay you. Customer service is useless. You asked me rate you again. You lose a star.",negative
Such a glitch ridden app! Sometimes it works. Sometimes it'll just stop working. Sometimes you have no ability to pause the podcast you're listening too. Sometimes it won't open.,negative
Music will not continuously play. It pauses and resumes multiple times during each song during streaming play for no reason. This occurs on all devices excluding my desktop. Looking for a new streaming service.,negative
Many more attributes than detriments. I find it as a must have app.,positive
"Loved Spotify until the latest update - now refuses to play a majority of the time without a reboot. Much more skipping and freezing than before. Please undo the latest upgrade, shopping around for a replacement",negative
Good app very useful,positive
"A new bug with every update. Maybe you should stop making updates... So many nice features, that work only sometimes - so frustrating!",negative
This app is so good,positive

Don't use the paid version. Lots of adds. But good line up of music.,positive
"Playback bar (aka where you control the playing, pausing and fast forwarding etc) keeps disappearing on Android phone. This makes the app essentially useless. Seems to be the latest update. Even on my Premium account. Android users get screwed once again!",negative

"Lately it's been telling me ""Spotify is trying to play"" and I'll have to close the app and reopen it. It'll pause midway through a song and the app will be stuck on a previous song but the audio will keep playing.",negative
Best app. It has become part of my daily routine listening to music on this app. Amazing app!,positive
good but i hope they lessen the ads and let us listen in offline without premium,negative
"there's a lot of repetitive ads, lots of glitches, the app will randomly stop for no reason, 1-3 minutes worth of ads between every two songs and then there's the ad that says ""enjoy your 30 minutes of ad-free music"" and it plays like two songs with yet again ANOTHER AD. it's a good app sometimes but other times it's annoying.",negative
Something is happening my music will randomly stop while I'm listening to it. Fix this bug it was fine until yesterday.,negative
You can find songs old and new and lyrics are provided as the song plays...that's just one of the many likable things on spodify...â¤â¤â¤,positive

"Awesome app! Wish it was a bit cheaper since there are so many subscription based (and free) apps out there that are cheaper. But I have used Spotify for forever and are so used to it, I'm also a loyal customer. In the last couple of years it has become a bit to expensive for me and I can't have ads running since I'm streaming games :( I still recommend it to everyone I know and I love the app! Great work with the app, you guys are awesome and don't get enough credit!! Keep it up, much love! <3",positive
Fix the now playing and Bluetooth issue. My phone is running on Android but it's not Samsung.,negative

"I have no clue what's happend to my Spotify app it was working perfectly fine and now I load it up click on my playlist and all my music is gone, yet on xbox and my laptop my music is there, I don't understand why it not there on the phone app and it not just my playlist it's literally ever song on there u cannot play if it was still working this would be a 5 star rating. don't bother asking support because I was talking to them for hours and they still didn't have a clue. FIX THE APP!!!!",negative

Good,positive
Good app for listening music.,positive
"Using premium since past 6 years. Great suggestions for every mood. Only downside, it doesn't auto play new songs if you have searched and played a particular one.",negative
"For me, spotify is the best streaming platform for people who have other things to do on their phone but still want to listen to music. This app has been with me for aslong as i can remember and you dont need premium to use it while using other apps. Though it is quite a bit laggy, In my pc, it repeats the first 6 seconds of a song over and over, and you have to restart the song inorder to play the song. Overall great app though",negative
Spotify is great but I don't want shuffle and I don't music added to my playlist for me if I don't add it it's because I don't want it and I want to listen my playlist in order and I don't want to start in a random place in it but again spotify is great... if you can pay for premium,positive
Perfect app. Great stability and streaming. I have been a Premium member for a year and Spotify does not disappoint ^-^,positive

It is amazing app for listening all songs,positive
That s app is amazing love itðŸ˜Ž I can hear music whenever I want.,positive
Very glitchy. I switched from Google podcasts to this app so I could listen to my podcasts from my Samsung watch. Stops playing randomly and there is now no way to scrub forward when I have to restart a podcast after restarting the app. I was able to put up with the clunky navigation but with the controls disappearing I will switch back to my old podcast service that doesn't cram pay for play features in my face.,negative
app not functioning properly for months. Music play/pause button not showing.,negative
I am a collage student and i can't afford premium even after the discount and I get it that it is trying to push its customers towards buying premium but the number of ads are getting outrageous nowadays. Mocking your free user isn't going to get them buy premium it will just push them away. It has now become an app which is just insensitive towards poor people,negative
"Always has a problem. This app has a multitude of bugs that need to be fixed. If it's not one thing it's another, and it takes forever for them to fix it. I've used spotify for going on 8 years now, and it's been horrible these last few years.",negative
"So far, so good. Good design collection as well!",positive
Not sure why you cannot remove a song from a playlist in the options when on the song view . You can remove from playlist from the list view only - which is really frustrating. I have to now go back to my list view just to remove a specific track from the playlist? Makes no sense,negative
"Its amazing for listening to music but you cant pick any song you want, sometimes it doesnt shuffle and when you try to find a song you have to skip through songs to find it and you cant get to the song cause you run out of skips.",negative

I really like this app find all my favorite podcast and music.,positive

"App is designed for kids lacking the attention span to enjoy an album. Should have an option to open Band- then automatically list albums in chronological order, not backwards. Shuffle should be removed.",negative
Cool app but some songs are no loaded,negative
They charged me multiple times without my permission and I am still trying to get my money back. Don't trust a free trial from this app I will update when (if) I get reimbursed. I did not even use the app while I was being charged.,negative
I would like to play the song in full also stop with so much abertizing and please let me play my own song for example I play xxxtenacion and put lii mosey please work on that,negative

"Skipping, pausing, terrible playback experience. Spotify refuses to accept that there are major issues with their playback system at least on the Android app. Myself and several friends have random pauses, skips, and other bugs regularly during playback. It has gone on for at least a month. When I contacted Spotify they brushed it off and told me it wasn't an issue.",negative

Best sounds awesome ðŸ˜Ž experience with Spotify! ðŸ˜,positive
They choose to platform misinformation. On top of that their ads just repeat over and over in succession it's nauseating.,negative
The new update is making this goddamn app IMPOSSIBLE!! I want to be able to chose a song from my playlists again!!!! I cant even put particular songs without it randomly giving me a totally different one!!,negative
the new update sucks. 1. at first it didn't let me listen to a song i was already listening to when i went away from the app for a second. 2. then it's stopped giving me the opportunity to listen to songs i want to add to my playlist and now i can't find new music to listen to because i can't listen to the song and decided if i want to ad this to the playlist or not! 3. now it's not letting me getting into the app! it's shows a black screen. as someone who has spotify premium it's disgusting.,negative
I love the app just don't like that fb messenger makes the Spotify page freeze or glitch needing to be refreshed and sometimes it skips during songs like a old CD lol. I like the set up in general great for sharing and finding all kinds of music ðŸ¥°,negative

Pretty good app but buggy and way to many ads. Pretty sure I spend more time listening to ads then music sooo I normally just use YouTube instead. Also it randomly pauses & replays some songs in a playlist before playing others at all.,negative
Great platform for me to listen to podcasts!,positive
The best 1000 percent u can find any song and music,positive

Spotify is great app music is great too many ads tho I would recommend mutify if you cannot afford Spotify premium,negative
"I live on this and songcloud all day everyday 95% of the time. Changes- lift the band on certain songs and or albums. If I'm paying for the service shouldn't I get to hear Any dang song I want when I want? But certain ones are blocked or ""unplayable"". I'd also change up the adding and subtracting of songs to playlists. Should be able to add more than 1 at a time. So can be very time consuming especially if like me and have 45+gb of music. That's a whole lot of music to be adding 1 by 1.ðŸ¤˜ðŸ˜ˆðŸ¤˜",negative
The thing is this is spotify lite not normal spotify and I wasn't having any problems with normal spotify.,negative
"I have been a happy customer of premium for a few years. However the app was more stable 3 years, and even 3 months ago than it is now. The player disappears at the bottom of the screen. This means you don't have access to the MOST BASIC functions that a walkman would have haha. Many ways to mess up an app, but breaking the ability to see what is playing, and play pause skip tracks and go to previous tracks is absurd.",negative
I love it,positive
Really glitchy on my new Samsung s22 ultra. I had no problems before.,positive
Wanted to queue my Playlist. Couldn't find that option,negative

It's great even U can play songs with less internet but after two songs ads come we can't even skip them,positive
Spotify on phone is good but web player is really bad... Sometimes the song isn't even coming out but the time of the song is running.. I thought it was problem with my laptop but later found out it's the same case for many of my friends... There's something wrong with spotify web player please take a look at it,negative
"Like music, must have,very good ðŸ‘",positive
"15 Apr 2022 update: the buttons disappear so you start playing something then it becomes impossible to pause, like or skip tracks without restarting the app. Something is obviously broken in a recent update. Spotify has been so buggy for most of the time I've had it. When I get time I'll seriously look at cancelling premium and switching to a competitor.",negative
I do like the app but I don't like how there is limited skips and its so annoying I hope they fix that.,negative
It has all my favorite songs and podcasts In inglish and not,negative
Still laggy and unresponsive in 2022. Support does nothing. Regret paying for this service.,negative

good with premium,positive
"This is a good app, I like the music, it gives me alot of good brain chemicals",positive
Its good till you are done listening because if you want to hear the song again spotify plays some random song even if i put it on my playlist it wont play because spotify keeps adding other songs and it keeps playing them instead of the song i want and i cant find a way to stop it,negative
Its a very good music app but the one thing I dont like is how we have to pay for us to pick any song in any order and i dont know if its just me but i cant put any song on loop but its a good app,positive
If you have premium than only you can use it,positive
The Best,positive
Buggy to the point of unusable. Podcast plays but all the player functions randomly disappear so there is no way to pause or control the play without stopping the app and starting over. Maybe you should spend money on a functional player rather than buying Joe Rogan.,negative
Have to uninstall and then reinstall like every other day. Constantly is just stopping or starting on its own. I only continue using it until I find a new app for my music and run out my subscription.,negative
Literally have to reinstall this app everyday. It just doesn't work. Probabally should end my membership. This is garbage.,negative

I thing I already made 4 account but still I can't enjoy this app features. Please please",negative
I literally love this app and I have premium but it keeps pausing at random times and unliking songs. And I cleared the cache and it still is doing it,positive
"The app continues to be unable to pause. Have to open app, go into the player and tap it 2 times for it to react. Its been happening for about 2 weeks. Before you updated the app in November it worked perfext. Like to add its racist and supports conspiracy theories!!",negative
Almost everything is now a premium feature you can hardly do anything but I still like listening to music with the app,positive
Has some buggy music features but pretty good premium,positive
"I LOVED Spotify, It's the only subscription I feel like I simply cannot go without. However, as of recently the control center where you play, pause, skip ahead, etc has disappeared 90% of the time. So now, it I play something, I can't pause unless I close the entire app. Please fix!",negative
"I love the design and the delivery. I just realised it compatible with my Google Mini Home, and booom, its fun ðŸ˜„ time.",positive

Great sound great selection,positive
"Brilliant app, however after my last update there are bugs that need fixing. The sound gets muffled after taking or making WhatsApp calls.",negative
Love to have an easy explicit toggle. Great overall. Plays random things sometimes and I'd like to not scroll through settings to make sure I don't play inappropriate stuff with kids in car.,negative
Works well. Ads can be annoying. But otherwise nice.,positive
When I click on a link to open Spotify the track I clicked on doesn't play. Pretty pointless really.,negative
It has all my favorite music on it for a decent price. And I love how they have podcasts. I listen to a nature sound one to go to bed.,positive
"Used to love it, but now that they changed it so that my music and podcasts are in the same place I hate it. And because they changed it know it's almost impossible to find my downloads. Pretty much unusable.",negative
great app for music streaming. and very affordable subs rate,positive
Notification bar glitches.,negative
After using this app I found Playing next track takes long time even on high network area. It can able to share song recommends good songs according to our mood .,positive
This app used to be great and the only thing I'd use to listen to music but now I can't login or else it crashes my phone and forces it to restart. I can't delete it because it crashes my phone and forces it to restart and so my only option would be to factory reset my phone.,negative
I absolutely love Spotify!!!,positive
The app works great I was using iHeartRadio iHeartRadio and in front of my introduced me to spotify I use spotify now when I don't use iHeartRadio.,positive
Everything you could want to listen to at the tip of your fingers! Fantastic choices frome a massive range of music categories. Definitely worth the subscription fee. â¤ï¸,positive
"First off bad company, but honestly I'm used to terrible companies so eh. My main issue is that this app has done nothing but crash for the past 5 days. The absolute best I can get is maybe 2 minutes of a song before it crashes. If I have the app open then it will keep playing and ask me to reopen the app, at which point it stops and won't reopen. If I'm on a different app, it will pretend it never existed and go back to the start of the song if I can open it again. Or I just can't open it. Fun",negative
So i was feeling sick the other day and downloaded this app to listen to songs. First it gave me multiple options to login. I tried with gmail but it didn't continue with that. Then i tried with my phone number and i didn't get otp and then asked me to enter my Date of birth for listening to a song.... I uninstalled it and felt much better.,negative
"The best, I get to listen to my favorite songs",positive
Ads during podcasts even on premium! Disgusting! Does not allow podcast video to play when connected to Bluetooth speaker or earbud! Managed to find a workaround by switching off android Bluetooth device connection options (found under Bluetooth in settings) then turning them back on. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED THIS ON THE SPOTIFY COMMUNITY. It's blindingly obvious it needs to be fixed. Why the heck are there ads on premium during podcasts!? Unbelievable.,negative
"Just love music, music is my life and Spotify helps me listen to it",positive
"I love Spotify, one thing that bugs me is that when I pay it changes my plan to a different one and when I try to change it back it says I'm on the one I was originally on but this takes out money for the duo plan",negative

Super app . But lyrics is not showing in my app,negative
GooglePlay please enable us to give 0 stars as well,positive
I like the quality and it's easy to use but I also don't know if it's normal that you can't go in a radio station like for example when I want to go in Karol G radio station it just shows other stations and won't really let you play or see the songs in that station I just want to know if its normal or not.,negative
I can't skip any songs properly. From today. It is showing that you can skip only 6 songs in per hour. Please solve the the proBlem,negative
I would give it 5 stars but when I update it I can't really play my music anymore an I can't find my Playlist,negative
Spotify is great you can listen to all kinds of music and even make your own playlist enjoy everything from the oldies till now don't take my word for it get Spotify today enjoy everything you like to hear in the way of music,positive
"Song/music selection is so easy to get plus other artists with a similar song/genre is available, making you're playlist far more enjoyable....",positive
They show ad on next every single song. I'm getting frustrated.,negative
Look I got the ads part but not being able to restart the song or not being able to skip tracks for another 30 mins? Are u kidding? That just makes peopel wanna delete the app instead of paying for premium.,negative
I Give It a five star because you can listen do any music you like and it has the best taste,positive
"Everything in this app I'm good but there's alot of ads spamming like every 2 songs there's an ad, you earn by ads but it's not good if there's too much",negative
Spotify speeches are better than other sites That's why I like it,positive
I hate this so much. I don't even get to listen to the songs I want to listen to because I don't have premium. I want to listen to something else and it plays a different song and won't let me play the song I want. Currently crying because of this.,positive
I love this app the best app for music,positive
"This most recent update is nice, letting Android users have similar experiences to Apple users. However I find that the app will close or stop my songs when I'm not in the app and that when I initially open the app my 'now playing' song doesn't show up it just starts the song. So I have to close and open it again.",negative
Beautiful songs and overwhelming playlists it has I am satisfied â™¥ï¸,positive
Great for listening to music while doing others things on your phone,positive
ðŸ’”Tamil songs lirics full of mistakes ðŸ˜¢pls solve the problem.. thats only happend english alternation..,negative
Good app but the ads that claim to give you 30 minutes of ad free listening do not in fact give you 30 minutes of ad free listening. After about 12 minutes you get hit with two or three ads in a row.,negative
"Spotify is great, but the App often does not show the playing song.",negative
Too many ads even after free 30 mins video ad comes after one song ..not fair for the consumers,negative
"It was fine, now it keeps crashing..",positive
"Good app, but lots of Add",positive
"This app is good because it caters for my preferences and keeps me updated with new songs and artists. But I gave it a 4 star rating because you can't download any song, so you can't listen to music when you are offline. If this could be changed I would give it a 5 star rating. Hoping for a feedback.",positive
I love it but you should include a rewards program for people who rate 5 stars and use the app daily or very often ( just a good idea),positive
It is best for music field,positive
Any music or podcasts anytime anywhere!,negative
Fine,positive
BEST APP EVERY you can skip but not to much you can borrow othors playlists and your playlists can be huge love it you need to get it,positive
Awful music app. Censored and missing tracks. Leave your political ideas out of me trying to enjoy music.,negative
"Horrible app, greedy devs. They specifically find the most annoying ads possible, crank up the volume so it's way louder than your music, and try to jumpscare you into paying for premium. Not to mention the fact that you aren't allowed to listen to the songs you want, only playlists ""based on"" a song of your choosing which often doesn't even contain the song you want to hear. Also the number of ads have gone up a ridiculous amount lately. Looking for another service to switch to immediately.",negative
new update is hot trash. select library and it puts you immediately into your playlists. what happens if i don't use playlists? now you just added an extra step for no purpose. artists are now randomly listed. no alphabetical order. no rhyme or reason. I've downloaded these songs dozens of times and everytime they do another ill conceived update all songs are deleted yet again. albums are a disaster. no organization.,negative
"Love the service! Just wish they had lyric videos with the canvases. Still, 5 stars!!ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¼ But, my canvas are gone! It's not an option on my settings and I own a Galaxy S21 ultra. Why Spotify, why?!?! This is the second time!!!",negative
"why did u get rid of the sort playlist button, it was my best friend ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™",negative
"Excellent App to use for music, just loving it!",positive
It is a very good app. It has all the music you need. So you should all try it,positive
"This has been my favorite music provider for years but I'm highly disappointed in all the glitches I've been experiencing these past few months. If things don't get fixed soon, I'll have no other option but to change music streaming services.",negative
I love spotify. It says it's downloaded.. Why can't I see it?? Now it says I have multiple devices. I still can't see spotify?,positive
Update 2022 May 9. Now I can't add a song to a Playlist without it taking me to the top of the Playlist and causing me to lose my spot. FIX YOUR APP!!!,negative
"Would rate it better if YOU RETURNED THE ABILITY TO PREVIEW THE SONGS BEFORE YOU ADD THEM TO YOUR PLAYLIST! Seriously what idiot decided it was a good idea to remove that feature?? Also the ads, yes i get it you need money and stuff but do you really need to give 2 30 second ads every song? Also the fact you search up a specific song and ITS PUT IN AS A PLAYLIST. WHATS THE POINT OF THAT?? Other than that its a good app, just has some problems.",negative
Awesome! So many great podcasts and musicians on here!,positive
My favorite feature is the operating while in the background.....,positive
I love the app but they recently did an update where they were giving the playlists and artists section a new look but they also change it where you can't have your artists sorted by alphabetical or recently added you can't separate that from playlist which you used to be able to do before so you could have your playlist sorted by alphabetical where as your artist was sorted by newly added or whatever and now it's gone,negative
Love it for my favorite podcasts,positive
Best music app if you're a paid user. Although the podcasts are trash and get recommended on the home screen that you can't remove so it's really irritating.,negative
Best app i find all the kpop songs i want to,positive
"This is a lousy amateur app. Nothing but problems. Spotify will no longer work with Alexa so downloaded app to see if this would work. Won't allow me to sign in. Keeps sending me links that expire straight away. A professional outfit should do better than this. For these reasons, Spotify App has Junk Status. Not Recommended!!",negative
"Since latest update the app is literally useless unless you pay premium. You cant even listen to the song you search for, instead its shuffled into a playlist of random similar songs and you just have to wait to find it in the selection as skipping songs is now a premium only feature.",negative
Too many ads. Sometimes listen to one song then get 3 ads in a row,negative
Very high quality music,positive
The best streaming service yet.,positive
It's ok but I disabled the playback yet it still keeps playing suggested songs and it's really annoying because the suggested songs aren't even good,negative
"I love it, all my music, when I want it.",positive
Full of ads,negative
Easy to use and made life enjoyable,positive
Who decided to delete the preview option? Like we need that to know whether the reccommended songs are fit to our playlist before we decided to put it there. Just please give our songs preview back thanks.,negative
"I hate that i can't listen to what I want. I can't choose a song, and I have to wait and listen to the whole playlist to hear song i want. I also hate limited skips and how Spotify itself puts songs on my playlists. The sound quality is really good but you have to fix somethings",negative
i just don't make it 5 Stars cuz its not possible to see who liked my playlist rest? 10/10,negative
I hate the new update where you can only play the full versions of songs on shuffle. It is really annoying please fix it. I will change my review when this is fixed,negative
My experience is very good because this is the only app I used at home during work . Hearing podcasts and songs are cool ðŸ˜ŽðŸ†’,positive
Why so hard for payment premium now? Why it must be with credit card?,negative
Excellent choice to download for the crazy music lovers,positive
I love music of all types and too have the ease to play music I love anywhere anytime anyplace .,positive
Great for making playlists and listening to a wide variety of music.,positive
The app is very very nice. I love this app so so much....,positive
Great concept but the app is very buggy.,negative
Can find varieties/category songs as we need,positive
I love making doffrent playlist and they have everything but they changed it from on 30 second ad every 30 mineuts to 3-6 30 second ads before 30 mineuts no ads and its kinda annoying,negative
Brilliant music app better then amazon music well worth the money,positive
"Music, podcasts, life at ur fingertips. Control from your phone, send to Bluetooth, Chromecast, Playstation, etc.",negative
It's a tiny bit slow at times but otherwise great. I love the download feature for when I'm driving and offlineðŸ˜,positive
Getting music with this app is more efficient and more available to me than other music apps I've used.,positive
"Seems like there is a glitch recently? Whatever song is playing is not showing up at the bottom of the app like normal so I can't pause, skip, etc. It's so frustrating",negative
This is the best to listen to all music you will enjoy it and never need anything else. Spotify is the greatest. Still the best from 2020 til now still grooving,positive
This is by far the best app for music thank you,positive
"Right now as soon as I start vacation it is not working, not loading. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, forced stopped, restarted my phone. This is beyond annoying!!! Edit, got a new phone and app still not working!!! Everyone else in my family plan has a working spotify except myself and I am the plan account holder.",negative
"I am a new user and am enjoying Spotify. One improvement would be a sleep timer. I love to go to sleep at night and have the music turn off. It would be nice to have an alarm, as well.",negative
I like the app works very when I want to listen to music during class,positive
"What a major downgrade... since this recent update, it lags to open up, takes like 15 seconds to play a song, stuck on loading after a search (have tried on both wifi and non) have cleared the cache and still not working properly. Looks like I'll have to cancel my subscription and switch over to something else",negative
COOL,positive
Stop adding songs to my playlist,negative
brilliant app.long awaited in India. gives me the kind of music i like. Song radio feature is outstanding.,positive
"Dogshit you can only play a song playlist/album if you shuffle, If you do it's gonna be a preview of the chorus. Absolute dog water no wonder the app is only #2 ðŸ’€",negative

"Just about every song you could want is here. Easy to use, and I really like that Spotify alerts me when my favorite artists have new music.",positive
"Love it. Got 3 months free with Samsung. Fairly easy to use app, i have tried other apps before, but this is def. One of the better ones.",positive
"""Enjoy the next 30 minutes of ad-free listening."" Time to next ad: 15.5 minutes. This is a small issue, but it errodes my trust in your brand and contributes to my hesitation about getting a premium subscription.",negative
Very good app for people of all age group and excellent for senior citizen,positive
It wouldn't go past the loading screen even after trying to restart my device and uninstalling and reinstalling the app.,negative
"Constantly loses track or current podcast episode, randomly switches episodes during a podcast and marks it as played. I thought this was due to my older pixel 3 but the issues carried over to my new pixel 6. Due to these issues and lack of other heavily requested features I could never get behind a premium subscription New issue - Android notifications, like weather updates, causes Spotify to switch to the next song/podcast",negative
"I have been using Spotify for a few years now and have been pleased with the overall user experience and interface. I love that not only can find a variety of podcasts and music, Spotify recommends similar podcast topics and songs based on what I listen to, which only makes driving even more enjoyable. I also appreciate that I can be listening to something on my phone and then switch on my laptop / Smart TV and continue listening there. Great Job, Spotify! ðŸ’š",positive
I give five star âœ´ï¸ amazing app music ðŸŽ¶ quality very good and,positive
"I thought at first Wow what an amazing app so much better than YT music. But oh wait this morning I went into the app and it said ""your 14 day free trail has stopped"" WHAT I DONT EVEN HAVE PREMUIM! Now it has ditched all its good functions - example - ONLY 6 skips per hour, Can only play specific songs. The dumbest app ever. I'd rather pay for YT premium Than use this. 0 STARS IF I COULD RATE IT.",negative
I used to love this app right until I had a ton of problems with.I tried to fix it multiple ways like look for updates or search up on Google the answers but I just gave up and deleted it.,negative
Spotify is the best app i ever used i felt that spotify is connect with my soul and heart what ever my mood is spotify play that type of songs for meðŸ˜ i love spotifyâ¤,positive
I like all the variety of music you have on here however when I make a playlist and I usually have about 40 or 50 songs on there it keeps playing the same 5 or 10 songs over and over again without playing the other songs that are on my playlist that really sucks it's no different than listening to the radio the idea was so I wouldn't have to listen to the same songs over and over again but this app plays the same music over and over again without playing every song in your playlist pointless,negative
The app sometimes plays the wrong songs when I try to listen to my Playlists and it goes on for a while...,negative
Easy to use UI and great music selection.,positive
The reason I give this app a five star rating is because you can listen to music . yes there is a lot of ads but its worth it because I just listened to music for 4 hours and my battery was at 100 and when I was done listening it was at 92. also you can listen to music with your phone off. those are my reason on why this app is the best. Anyhow this is my experience and not everyone thinks the same way. I have had this app since November 2020. I recommend this app But every ocassion is different,positive
"Playbar has disappeared so can't pause or skip, music stops and starts unless actively using phone, control from drop down notifications doesn't work and has a totally different song to what's on listed. It's also no longer automatically pausing after disconnecting from Bluetooth, ie getting out of car. Have been a paid subscriber for years so disappointing to see this happen after updating a few days ago...",negative
"spotify is amazing!!! but im upset at the fact that i cant listen to a snipet of a song before adding it to my playlist anymore. this feature was super helpful :((. im not sure if its a bug, but if it is please fix it! and if not please add the feature back :(",negative
"I love listening to music daily, and spotify make it easy to stort out my music and make playlists. Even whithout spotify premium I still enjoy the app. The daily mixes are a feature that I especially love <33! I am not able to see the lyrics update, but that is probably because my phone is an older model. The lyrics work just fine on my computer :)",positive
Able to pick and choose music from genre I enjoy listening to.,positive
"Anyone else found that since the last update their Spotify just randomly cuts out and also can't see what song they're listening to? Or just me? Like I press shuffle, music comes out, I wanna skip the song but nope, cannot even pause it. Starting to get on my nerves now ngl",negative
"I've been using premium for 2 years now, and right now the app is better than ever. All the compact design, easy to navigate functions, I just love to use Spotify.",positive
"who thought that shifting all the playing controls to the left was a good idea? it's not. it's terrible. it hurts my hands and my eyes, but my soul the most.",negative
Good music choice but the play bar has disappeared on app and on lock screen so I can no longer change the songs etc. Very annoying! Spotify need to sort this out!,negative
Love this app been using it for a couple of years no problems found at all,positive
"Too often Spotify says ""No internet connection"" I have premium Tried: logging out and in. Updated app. All permissions are active. Downloaded plenty of songs, they won't play. I use mobile data and tried WiFi. I made sure my phone settings were all active for app data usage. Very frustrating",negative
Awesome app for music and podcasts,positive
The app keeps suggesting songs that I have hidden. The app desperately needs a dislike button available at all times that will then skip the song no matter what playlist you are listening to. The hide song feature is also available only on certain playlists. Lastly to cancell your subscription you need to login on a Web browser then confirm your cancellation what feels like 100 times before it finally believes you don't want it anymore.,negative
This app used to be so good. Now it's awful! Crashes! Controls disappear. Starts playing randomly even when the app is closed down!,negative
Over restrictions Over advertising,positive
This all is good but without premium we have to listen so much ads btw this so good,positive
Very very good and ni ads this is best app,positive

I LOVE SPOTIFY! There is only 1 problem theres ads that randomly pop out of nowhere and u have to watch them if u dont pay premium. But overall very good!,positive
"This app is a must have, EXCELLENT!!! You can't get a better music app. The absolute best",positive
"Overall it is a great app for podcasts with copious amounts of content but problematic on my Chromebook. I have problems several times a day where it stops showing me what is playing in the left side panel, preventing me from interacting with the podcast in any way. The only way I can fix it is to go into settings and completely delete the app's storage then log back in. This of course wipes out anything I have downloaded. Unfortunate but prevents me from using the app as much as I would like.",negative
"So easy to use! Thanks, kd",positive
"Works real good like using it, thanks.",positive
"It tells me 30 mins no ad music and while im working out 10 mins later an ad,false advertising",negative

It has great music and you can find any kind of music,positive
Such cumbersome signup..must have tried 10times but always some error,negative
"I've been using Spotify for years and my review starts at a 4 and it's now at 2. I don't understand how an app that is so ubiquitous and dominant in it's sector is so freakishly buggy! Crashes in miduse, auto playing but not realizing it's on so I have to close and reopen the app so it recognizes that it's on (otherwise it just plays with no way to control it) and it doesn't sync well with smart devices despite having partnerships and dedicated features for Spotify. Make it make sense please.",negative
"Bad to worse. Playing offline had been hit or miss. Now, downloaded song are just not available offline. So if you live and work inside buildings, you won't have your music. Been a premium customer for years. Dropping it now. There's no point in paying for a useless app.",negative
"Songs are being randomly skipped, the app does not show that any song is being played and media controls intermittently stop working too. It was much better a few years ago.",negative
Since this update I cannot fast forward nor rewind the song Did this become a premium feature The lyric not always available But the AI generated music choice for me is wonderful I do not get vulgar worded songs and I am very thankful for it why the 5 star rating The AI did not take long to eliminate bad worded music for me by the second week using the app my music exper6was clean,positive
"Reasonable range of tunes, but a few artists",positive

Hello I was wondering if you's are ever going to fix a problem that's been happening for quite sometime now probably it came with the update but apparently it's not showing the bar where you have control of pausing and skipping the music it shows the soundtrack at the bottom of the app when you play a song and when I come back it just suddenly disappears instantaneously. Hopefully you's fix it. I tried uninstalling and restarting my phone and it still does the same thing it disappears.,negative
Best Music App!,positive
If you want a free mobile music app then skip this as it is terrible. Can only stream 2 songs before the app forces 5+ ads.,negative
The best music app ever,positive
Best music streaming app you can find!,positive
App is vary good but many updates,positive
My best app which ever been seen before like it more and forever no add less data yeaah like it,positive
I no longer have the option to preview songs.,negative
Cant skip song,positive
"Is exactly what it advertises itself to be, music and podcasts. Excellent. App sometimes bugs out. Still very good.",positive
Overall a very nice app better than resso. It has all songs available which i want to listen. There are not ads it is just minimum. Very nice app. Only the place where you have to improve is auto recommendation and music according to taste of user. You have to improve on that. At last please add one more feature 'listen together' So that two people listen same song at same time but at different places . Plz add this feature,positive
Really enjoy the customized play lists! Has almost everything I could ever want to listen to.,positive
"How do you turn it off when you're done listening,instead of just pausing???",negative
Sometimes it lags,negative
"I love this app it's the best one I've found. It works on & off life. Suggest new music, shows some videos, easy to manage, & no limit on download yet. It's affordable and has several different settings for house, car, or Bluetooth. Highly recommend I haven't needed anything else for music",positive
It is sooooo easy to use but it has many advantages it also shows the lyrics . Soo 4 stars,positive
Best music app ever !,positive
local files cannot ne read anymore. please fix.,negative
Very nice quality of voice,positive
"Worst app I've ever had the displeasure of installing on my phone. After months of burning through my data, dropping my place in podcasts and starting different ones for no apparent reason, and deleting downloaded podcasts I was in the middle of, finally the app has deleted my entire library and will not allow me to search for any of it or change anything about my profile. Thankfully I have not wasted any money on this product, only my time is lost.",negative
Because its very work full,positive
"perfect except that not playing what i want thing. its just annoying. (frankly reminding that TYLER, THE CREATOR is best)",positive
"Well, all in all Spotify Premium is great and so is the app in general, i can listen and download my music and podcasts but when I'm offline some of my downloaded music doesn't play and it crashes occasionally.",negative
By far the best music service out there!,positive
Excellent I can listen the music what I want ðŸ˜thanks for this...,positive
Love this ap. Play my songs when I want. No interruptions. Very few adds.,positive
I Love it you choose what you want to hear or the Artist that you like and I love hearing La La song Let It Go and Some Days or better than others and All the Olde Goldies just great music thanks!!,positive
Everytime I want to play a song a different song is covering the song I wanna play,positive
"This is a great app, I put this app at number one among my favorite apps, I enjoy this app a lot, a lot of love for Spotify ðŸ’šðŸ’šðŸ’šðŸ’šðŸ’š",positive
Hate that random songs can just come next when playing a specific album from my country. But it's a good app. Not too many ads. Love that,positive
"I hate how it auto shuffles if you aren't premium. Plenty of playlists and albums have a specific order to listen to them in for the most enjoyment. Especially the ones I listen to. Seriously, who listens to the Hamilton soundtrack out of order?",negative
i enjoy the app. i have dicovered many good old songs and some new.,positive
LIVE Spotify!!! I refuse to use any other music app. XOXO,negative
"Easy to use, great quality and even recommends songs!! Luv this app it's the best.",positive
"I love this app, I can play all my favorite music. I'm so obsess with Spotify. You can find all the songs you like and play and you even have a playlist that's easy to make and not difficult like the other ones.",positive
Fantastic and a brilliant app,positive
App shuts off midway through music and the control panel disappears. This has been going on for months now.,negative
"Can't play any songs, the second one starts to play the app crashes, I've tried restarting my device clearing the cache of the app reinstalling and logging out and in again. Nothing works, Worked after may end update after a few days in the starting of june same glitch appeared. Makes me want to never use the app again",negative
It has too many ads and you only get 6 skips per hour and it adds songs to your playlist.,negative
"This is quite a nice music app, well developed and well thought, but I hate it that when I navigate the app offline, even if I downloaded like 800 songs, I can't play none of them. Like, that should be the perfect ideal situation the download option was created for. Even after closing and reopening the app several times, my downloaded songs won't play. So the thing is, I'm wasting around 4 gb of space for nothing. At this point it's better to get Spotify Free and not the Premium version.",negative
"yes best music app out there in my opinion. has lots of classics, and strives to add newly released songs as soon as possible. although the ads are EXTREMELY annoying, it is still the best app.",positive
I love it in general but in the last months the app stop working if my phone screen is lock...anyone else?? I cant see any update :(,negative
Sound quality in premium category has decreased. Earlier I was really impressed compare to any other music streaming app.,negative
Constantly issues with app. Have to redownload and then loose all saved and downloaded music. I think they do this so you have to download again. Thinking of switching to be honest. Glitches when listening to music also. I have complained about this on numerous occasions with no feedback.,negative
"Amazing, pick ur favorite song Artist..",positive
"Absolutely terrible... the ads are so bad, at least make a variety of them... I'm not getting pick n save, old el Paso, premium, anchor, give a variety and make it so these ads get at max 15 ads a year, and that is VERY fair, it has turned into a cash grab and I'm so sick of it... grow some common sense and play a variety of ads, the small companies cant get their day in the sun because you keep playing the exact same ad for legitimately over a year, with 0 changes... FIX IT!",negative
Nice,positive
Wonderful! Keeps me upbeat when I need it,positive
Music quality is best but sometimes your ads! So worst,negative
"Amazing app, overall, maybe could try to get some more songs :>",positive
"Previously I had rated 3 stars bcoz of the ads and lagging... But now, I would rate 10 out of 5.. bcoz of the excellent updations spotify has made. There's hardly any ad now. And the app is smooth like butter. No lagging at all! Just amazing Spotify! Thanks for the updations!",positive
"Rest all is amazing, the only problem is the large number of advertisements. The moment the mood lightens, advertisements are thrown on my face which makes it annoying many times. Please do something about that too.",negative
Too many ads! I understand the ap will have some ads but it's constantly giving me ads. The ap says it will give me 30 minutes of uninterrupted music but then 10 minutes later more ads(I set a timer at night). It feels like it's just a push to get premium.,negative
It's so cool literally any song you want too listen u can it's just like heaven,positive
Great selection of music easy to find,positive
Locks up frequently moving from video podcasts to music. Have to reset the phone. I absolutely can't believe Spotify has the nerve to give me ads on top of existing ads with joe Rogan podcast when I pay for maintenance device premium service. Three months later still same issues. Still a problem,negative
"I liked the app in the beginning. But now its too much about the money an not enough about the music. Shuffle is not shuffle it just repeats the playlist in the same order, every single time. (Even after i rearrange my playlists) Quality has down especially for the price now and zero ""grace"" period if you happen to miss one payment ðŸ™„ Spotify isnt the only music app around. I recommend anything other then spotify Lack of customer service Cant even delete my account without a thousand loops",negative
"With spotify it's not difficult to listen to music, it only gets better with the premium version because you can even listen to it offline. It helps a lot when I am stressed",positive
"Great music, awesome podcasts, but the app acts up and you have to uninstall and reinstall to fix it. Playlist rules are kinda dumb too, but still a good place for what you need",positive
I love bts songs sooo much thank for providing this allðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡,positive
These days sotify is showing kannada song and playing telegu songs. That's all the error in this app. Or else it is a very good app for songs. Thank you.,positive
Awesome app like lyrics bit by bit.i like itðŸ˜ðŸ˜âœŒðŸ‘,positive
App closing automatically when playing songs,negative
"It sucks. I made a playlist and it added a bunch of random songs. I tried taking them off but there were so many. Once i finally took them all out, whenever i tried to play my playlist it would play another random song that isnt in there. I was never able to listen to my playlist.",negative
Its hard to create a playlist because spofity adds songs without my permission its a flaw in the app and this needs to be changed,negative
Absolutely love it 100 out of 100,positive
"I love this app but I would really appreciate two things: 1. Ads: Sometimes ad starts very frequently ruining the mood and sometimes loosing temper. If possible you can fix that so that ads dont play before 30 mins. 2. Lyrics Language: Basically, I want to say that there should be an option where we can switch between the Original lyrics and Englsih lyrics of the song. Something like this: Original Lyrics: ""æ•™ãˆã¦ æ•™ãˆã¦ã‚ˆãã®ä»•çµ„ã¿ã‚’"" Engliah Lyrics: ""oshiete oshiete yo sono shikumi wo""",negative
It is good for music.,positive
Great Selection Of Music & Always On Time With The Vibe!!..Thanks!!.,positive
"The best music app... I can relax, unwind and energies with any song I wantðŸ˜ðŸ‘Œ",positive
"Using this app with a tablet or pc is decent, a few songs then ads but atleast you can choose the song you like to play unlike using a phone, it wont give you the song you wanted plus limited skips.",negative
"The latest update on 4/8/22 ruined the app! This needs an update asap, a lot of people are having problems with Bluetooth devices,it's so annoying please spotify fix all this bugs!",negative
"I really loved this app, I've been using it for years now, and it started to be bad. If I make a new playlist, and go to add songs, I cannot listen to any of the songs. PLEASE FIX THIS IM BEGGING ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­",negative
"It is not showing lyrics in my phone ,,,. Now its good ðŸ‘",negative
"First time signing up with Spotify, still learning how to use the application.",negative
Excellent choices so happy with my choices nostalgia finding music I loved back in the 80s and 90s,positive
"I want to stop downloading music because I'm not listening to it, but once I turn off the download, it continues to download, which is annoying because what's the point of turning off the download when it's still downloading? You should also include an easy-to-create playlist, such as my favorite songs. I put it on a playlist by category, but my patience isn't long enough to go through hundreds of songs one by one. There are many issues that can be improved. What a waste of money.",negative
"Why is it like this?! Im frustrated! I just want to play a specific song and everytime i search, it shows a play button with a ahuffle on the bottom and when i tap it, it will play another song, not the song i wanted to play! Why sis you turn the spotify into that? This is so frustrating.",negative
Vega music app,positive
If you want to enjoying the music so this app is best for you you can see all music of world in this app i like this app Thank you Spotify,positive
Thank you...you brought back the young girl in me! Love looking up the old music from the 80s,positive

I can find most of the songs I like and accept for a couple glitches it's been a great app to use.,positive
Awesome app with almost all songs available from,positive
"Good app runs smooth, thanks for your service Spotify.",positive
Pauses for no reason and podcasts just refuse too play at all,negative
"gives you upwards of 4 ads, each 30 seconds long, all unskippable, either every time you skip a song, or just after every few songs. it is disproportionate how many ads you get for the amount of music you get to actually listen to. i become more infuriated by this app every time i use it. it should be illegal to push this amount of ads in an attempt to force people to buy your garbage premium service just to avoid the onslaught of ads. disgusting",negative
Very good music. Very satisfy,positive
"I love this app and i really think the songs are better quality than the songs in resso, gaana, wink, etc...... I really recommended this app to all my frnds and cousins and some of them downloaded it too!! Where some are still addicted to MP3 or RESSO...... This makes playlists for me by my tastes and i get all the songs ima searchin by just typing 1 line from the lyrics... Worth 5 ðŸŒŸ guys pls go ahead and download this app... Thnx spotify!!!!!! ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ",positive
Great app the only problem is that when I'm listening to my liked songs i get some random songs saying that it's in my playlist when Its not even liked please get that fixed it's very anoyinng...,negative
"One of my the best music streaming app, so I give it 5.",positive
a friend at work who told me about Spotify I recently downloaded it and I LOVE SPOTIFY it's the BEST MUSIC PLAYING APP I've ever seen or used in ALL my life I deleted iHeart and Pandora because this is so GREAT AND FANTASTIC because I can save entire albums of my Favorite Rock and Country bands I Truly Love to listen to whenever wherever I want there's nothing better than Spotify in my Opinion for Good I REALLY LOVE SPOTIFY,positive
So easy to use and it is awsome app.,negative
Keeps stopping randomly and when I go to resume the song it starts it over,positive
"Me and my wife, love love Spotify!!",positive
"Absolutely awful! Fairly new to Spotify and whilst the selection of music is amazing, the app itself is very pool. Keeps asking me to allow it to play in the background by granting permissions (use of camera, contacts etc - have absolutely no idea why they'd need my camera and contacts!?).. Anyway, access granted, but it keeps pausing/freezing all the time! Judging by the reviews, they're aware of the issues but doing nothing about it. Cancelling my subscription, absolute thieves!!",negative
"I wanted to reinstall the app (it was working weirdly together with another player installed) and deleted it. Now it says the app is not available for my device. Turns out I paid for premium so that I won't have ads in my NO MUSIC and could skip between any of NO TRACKS. Why thank you, well worth it, 0/10. Coincidentally I can't even buy a new phone easily because someone brainfarted when designing esim tech and it's harder to transfer esim to a new phone then a physical sim card - and I would have to go to another country for that. My experience could not be worse.",negative
Awesome. But expensive. Should be 1 payment for membership.,negative
"Hard to use, can't change settings to your liking, plays random songs instead of what you are trying to play, too many ads.",negative
"Started using Spotify, and it totally opened up a fabulous music universe! Haven't looked back.",positive
"Currently the app randomly stops the music, and doesn't load the bar!",negative
There is a 30 second advertisement after each song and it is very irritating.,negative
"Spotify helps me reach out to ebooks, podcasts and all interesting stuff all at once.",positive
Missing play controls still... Is this a software/app or other problem...?,negative
Lovely,positive
It have a variety of songs but it really sucks.... it takes more than a minute for loading despite being online it shows no internet connection it loads really slow makes it really annoying for the users,negative
"Easy to navigate, music and podcasts made available. It's seamless usage at a luxury type of enjoyment, would definitely recommend",positive
Nicely curated play lists Highly recommended,positive
It adds other songs into my list and it has to shuffle the songs in playlist while i cant choose which certain songs i want to play,negative
"Usually love the app, recent update makes it unusable. It crashes on me every couple songs, which kind of puts a damper on the music. This only started happening after the recent update. The desktop app is jank too, it will randomly crash and then you can't even open it again. Please fix!",negative
Please fix the bug. It's really unpleasant having your music interrupted every 20 minutes. Might as well go get apple music at this point!,negative
"What the hell happened?? I used to love using Spotify but now it keeps pausing randomly in the middle of my songs and podcasts. And there's some kind of weird glitch where when you press play, it'll start playing the song. But you can't pause it, skip to the next song, or even see what song is playing. I don't know what happened but this app is barely usable at this point.",negative
"I can't even hear one single song because it only allows me to hear a section of the song. If I put it in a playlist, Spotify would just add random songs that I don't like which is not removable without premium.",negative
Excellent app. For the best sound quality turn normalisation off. It makes a huge difference.,positive
I hate the new update. I can't pause a song. I have to turn my phone completely off in order to turn the song off. The song isn't highlighted. It doesn't show up on the bottom of the screen. I pay for premium. I'm ready to cancel. If there is a way to do it I'd like to know. I've had this app along with my husband for years. Go back to the way it was. We had no problems. If the problem isn't solved I will be canceling.,negative
Spotify is an awesome app. It's meets my expecting greatly and the way everything is organized so I can find things easily is so nice. 10/10 rating for sure.,positive
Love the variety and listening to whole albums.,positive
"Music is good. The shifting ""shelves"" of topics constantly changing is annoying. Wanted to listen to some new albums in the ""New albums for you"" section, the section disappeared after only selecting one. Display all the types of shelves and let the user customize their position in settings and it would be better.",negative
I am stuck I scaned to my mom's iPad and now I can't play music on the ipad,negative
Cannot get to stop playing in the background. Canceling and uninstalling,positive
I love Spotify.,positive
"Everytime an ads wants to play, the next episode starts playing. The navigation of the app is sub par.",negative
Acha sound hai,positive
The best app to listen to your songs,positive
If you listen to music this app for you lol,negative
it's so endearing without adsðŸ¥²ðŸ˜Œ,positive
Just don't like it when the song stops and starts,negative
I love Spotify!! I have ALWAYS been able to find every song I'm looking for and every podcast too. Paying for premium is 100% worth it. Spotify is THE BEST app and I choose it over all the others out there. Thanks for being amazing Spotify ðŸ‘ðŸ˜.,positive
This is a good music app overall but the only thing anoying is there's so much ads that say thank you for listening to Spotify it's so anoying it's like made.ti anoy people but overall best music app ever,positive
I like 50s and 60s ðŸŽ¶ holds lots of memories for me and hubby John that I care for 24/7 we have sing song just the two of usðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ’ž,positive
It always says that the app has been stopped in old version of Android in Android Kit Kat 4.4.2 Samsung Tablet also proper always and I open and try to use it is stopped automatically I hate this why it is happening like this I don't understand the app is up to date still whenever I use it automatically it goes to black screen and says app stopped,negative
I love how when you put in a certain artist it gives you a list of songs in the same genre. Really makes it easier to look up songs and hear new ones you've never heard before ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘ðŸ‘,positive
"I listen music anytime. This is the perfect app for people like me. Buy yourself Spotify Premium, it's not a waste. There aren't some song, but it's the best music app ever!",positive
"Fix the app!! What is the point in paying for something that crashes all the time? Actually, I would be lucky if it crashed because it wont open most of the time! I am also tired of reinstalling it to work only a few times.",negative
I like Spotify but sometimes it plays so many adverts,negative
It's a great site for all types of music.,positive
Saves us from hunting songs the old fashion way and downloading it to all our devices. Thanks Spotify!,positive
I have one account but I have been charged for 2 I just wish someone would respond back,negative
Too many ads,negative

"Bye bye Joe Rogan. I already pay for Amazon Prime, good time to use it. Thanks for the reminder.",positive
"The app logged me out of my account, I've had to update my password and now the app stays on a screen with the logo and won't open at all. I have uninstalled and downloaded again and updated and it won't open.",negative
"Since I've gotten premium, whenever I close the app and come back let's say, 3 hours later, the timer says 3 hours over 3 minutes, and when I tap play, it skips the song. It happens all the time with songs AND podcasts. Also, when I come back to the app and press play, it plays for a sec, and then stops, requiring me to press play again.",negative
Yes definitely 1 star it is a superfreak on ads when I am listing to 1 or maybe 2 songs and it's really not that long a ad already. And sometimes the songs stop âœ‹ by itself and pauses by itself and is so laggy please tell me if any has these problems,negative
Latest update broke the app so now when I select music it doesn't populate on the bottom of the screen.,negative
Great music app crashes a lot though,negative
"The app is showing no internet connection problem, even when the mobile data is on. Fix this, its very annoying.",negative
I'm pleased how easybitbis for me to find music and listen plus the library bod music in here is amazing ðŸ˜,positive
"Love the app just wish it was alphabetical order. When I go to a music artist then go to a different artist I got to type the name of the band every time for it to pop up. I am a music connoisseur I have 1000 album collection of CD'S,Tapes and vinyl I need to find the my artist fast and easy and its not easy sometimes.",negative
"Used to like this aap. But now i don't like this aap as i am unable to listen to my favorite songs, it is added to a playlist and is not playing solo , also when i tried to return to song in shuffle list it was not working.",negative
Hi Spotify your app is amazing but i am facing some problem with this which is. Songs automatically stop in between overall the app is better than (I Music),negative
can't play songs from my playlist I'm forced to listen suggested songs when I press play my playlist,negative
Doesnt let you choose which favourite songs you want to play.,negative
"Annoying. The app will randomly start playing music while you're sitting in a meeting. While in your car, it continues playing when you shut off your engine. Lot of work to do on this one. Considering I had this same problem 2 years ago, I don't expect much to change.",negative
I listen to Spotify everyday since 2015 and haven't had a problem yet. Only thing I would you another platform for is music that is not on Spotify (unreasted music and sound cloud rappers),negative
The onlything is when payment is due Spotify cuttes out for3days,negative

"The app is great! Nothing wrong with it, it's just all the ads- before 2021 there were always one add every like 10 songs. Now it's like 3 ads every 5 songs- And not everybody can afford Spotify premium.",negative
Had to downgrade to 3 stars. What happened to the preview play button. Need to check what I am adding to my playlists,negative
Why do you add songs to peoples playlist if WE DIDN'T ADD them OURSELVES and why do random songs play if Spotify didn't add it to the playlist and nother did I like random songs will just start play for no f------ reason.,negative
I don't know what's the problem now from 3-4 weeks m not able to send songs in Snapchat because the songs image is not coming. PLEASE FIX THE ISSUE ASAP!,negative

Best aplication in music line ,positive
"I have a Samsung S22 ULTRA and use Spotify premium. Spotify now behaves like a broken record... It 'skips' when I play it on an external speaker. And for some reason, it no longer shows what's playing or let's me stop the music without restarting my phone. Come on Spotify. You should be getting better and not the other way. GET YOU ACT TOGETHER!",negative
"It's amazing how you can make a next song button not working after couple of quick song switches, even though the one in the notifications works fine. Only top 5 songs of the artist isn't fine too",positive
I'm new to Spotify and still learning. I'm sure that once l become a seasoned user I'll be in a better position to fairly judge the merits of the service.,positive
I've always liked Spotify and how it adjusts to my music tastes and changes. The sele tion of available artists and songs is also awesome.,positive
I love the app it's very much relaxing everytime I listen to the app,positive
Great can find all kinds of old songs,positive
Wonderful music app. I love the new music Spotify finds for me. Thank you.,positive

The app shows too many ads to push its premium pack,negative

This app is so good for me to listen songs,positive
Im Able to listen to and download whatever I want,positive

"i kinda hate this app now before it was great and when the updte came in its a whole new trashbag my issue is it stops randomly and there is no skip button when a 30 or 40 second ad came in and when i create a playlist for myself random songs just came in even if i didnâ€™t added it but im still not gonna delete this app since its the only app that i can listen with but please fix it its forcing me to use premium even tough i have no money :""D",negative

Its a beautiful application make you found all songs you wants ,positive
Spotify is the best app to listen Ads Songs intrupts in enjoying the ads,positive
"I have loved this app for years. Have never had a problem, until recently. I use Spotify on my laptop, desktop, Roku, and Android. I have no idea what's going on, but the mobile Android app shows empty playlists, whether it's a playlist I created or a Spotify playlist such as Daily Mix or Release Radar. I am able to see and play all playlists on every other device I use, just not my android. Also, I keep getting an error message that I'm not connected to internet on the Android app. Help??",negative
This is very good mp3 player,positive
everything is good but more ads even though not a problem,positive
Too many ads.,negative
Best app for music lover and easy functional....,positive
I like Spotify as a service but I dislike the app. I like organizing my playlists and have a lot so it's very annoying to have Spotify rearrange them based on usage every time I open the app. It's very annoying having to find my playlists every time because they are not in the same place.,negative
Really great app. I like that it now has lyrics for most of the songs and it has 95% of the songs I look for.,positive
Spotify keeps crashing in Vivo x80 phone after updating the app. Not able to play any song,negative

I just love Spotify and Services!!!!,positive
The play list created is fantastic. I really enjoy using Spotify,positive
The best music app ever. Very intuitive,positive
"The app is alright, although it has many flaws. The amount of songs with completely wrong, mistyped or simply not working lyrics is getting out of hand, please stop using Musicxmatch for lyrics. The interface is buggy and stiff, plenty of times doesn't even let you use premium options if you're in an area with weaker Internet and makes listening to music especially on a Bluetooth headset a hassle. Also, we're still waiting for the update to be able and see who has liked/followed our playlists.",negative
Refuses to work on my phone works fine on other devices have tried all steps to get it to work with zero success not good enough for something I pay for.,negative
Super annoying now! What's going on? Music just stops playing. The song bar gets lost and i can't even go to the next song if it is playing. I have to close the app and restart it too many times in one single day. Please.fix.this! I don't pay premium for this.,negative

"I'm using spotify for years now and I enjoy having premium. Still, the new updates are fixing old problems so I appreciate that :) However, I'm on this app hours a day and stream my favourite music!",positive
"I've been using Spotify for awhile and it's pretty great (once you pay for premium to not deal with ads and select the songs you want to hear in that moment). Recently the app has started to have a thing where is crashes out of nowhere while using it, so I hope that gets fixed soon.",positive
New update sucks Can't listen to podcasts I downloaded when I'm offline and sometimes I cannot start any music until I restart the app. Nevertheless one of the most important apps for music.,positive
Magnificent ðŸ’•. Best music streaming service.,positive
like it,positive
"Absolutely terrible app, I have had to re install multiple times and redownload all of the music I want to listen to offline even more. I am now sitting on the train unable to listen to the music I paid for while looking for an alternative. Avoid spotify at all costs.",negative
"When I installed Spotify at first, it was an amazing app with great features. 2 weeks later I now cannot disable shuffle and I no longer have a choice of what song I'm playing. Wouldn't install this app unless you want to waste Â£10 a month on a premium subscription.",negative
PLS HELP ME ITS SO CONFUSING I CANT FIND ANYTHING AND WONT LET ME LISTEN TO THE PLAYLISTS I MADE!!!!,positive
#NAME?,positive
I love the app but even with premium i get add,positive
"Not worth the downloadðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž. Waste of my internet data. What's wrong with this app??? I just don't understand, why? This app is not playing any songs, i can't hear the audio. Also when the search result shows, it's not allowing me to click on the song. Another one is that, it's not showing my account name correct. Very trashy appðŸ˜¡ðŸ‘Ž. I uninstalled it quickly.",negative
All in one service that allows me to access my library across devices. I love the UI as well as the easy to understand functionalities this app comes with.,positive
"Dear Spotify ""Ye teri Chand baliya"" I hate this song just because of you!!! Advertisement",negative
I use this app almost everyday! The only things is that I have to get premium to listen to the music I want to with click of my finger. I want to click on a song that I want to listen to and not have to pay premium but overall. Awesome app! Totally suggest downloading,positive
"App's standard has just plummeted after the recent update, I can't play anything, my playlists are empty (but still works just fine on the pc), I have tried uninstalling and installing several times but no success in getting anything to play. I've enjoyed using the premium version for a long time now and it's been great... please fix this.",negative
Just love it and the playlists are awesome.,positive
I wish it would play more of my original voice material..,negative
An excellent service that offers tons of great music for a fair price. The algorithim that Spotify created helps me find the music I like. I can even listen to an entire music channel based on the sound of one song or artist I've selected.,positive
Amazing Love how it connects to car radio automatically,positive
This app isfree music videos fancing too much latest songs this app has ads problem this app very easy to use,negative

Shuffle turns on at random. Play controls disappears at times,negative
Been buggy af lately.. not showing current song playing.. randomly closing.. trouble loading stuff etc.. and ANDROID STILL DOESNT HAVE SWIPE TO ADD TO QUEUE that's messed up.,negative
"They say that this app is the front runner but it doesn't look so. The add to queue option is working in a very dumb manner. Whenever a song/ album/ playlist is required to be added to queue, it means to the end of the existing queue of songs. This is the logical thought for any layman. However Spotify adds songs next to the current song that is playing, this is a basic app mistake and i am thinking of cancelling the subscription i made. Hope they correct this basic mistake.",negative
I really enjoy this app and all the music I love!!! I definitely recommend this app !!,positive
App working perfectly fine when it's on mobile data .. prblm come when it's connected to wifi... It's showing no network connection and search Is working.. tried with different wifis and different routers ... Working fine with mobile data... Please look into this issue ...

I really enjoy the company of spotify . Thank you so much,positive
"I've had spotify premium for a few years now but I will be cancelling it as the app is no longer user friendly. It constantly pauses, crashes, I can't pause music when I need to as the function has disappeared. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and then restarting my phone but it's not making a difference and it looks like I'm not the only one experiencing issues. Disappointing, to be honest, but I will have to find an alternative to stream music.",negative
The best music app,positive
I love Spotify.. the only thing I wish is that you could shuffle all of your Playlist together. Other then that it's amazing.,positive
Very good,positive
Surprisingly a large amount of music isn't here. But the convenience is undeniable,positive
Absolutely love it!! Been using Spotify for years (ever since 2016) and I can say that it is my favorite music streaming app of all time. Audio quality is wonderful and the EQ works like a charm,positive
"Best music application, hands down.",negative
I got ten ads! I just want to hear music.,positive
"Won't play the song I request, just keeps playing random music.",negative
"Is an extremely great platform for listening to music. Is completely free, and premium has a 3 month free period ,too. I listen to spotify everyday and it is amazing. The only issue I would point out Is that, although you can download the playlists, sometimes, although rarely, you can't open the app without internet.",positive
App doesn't work while connected to Wifi. I also had issues signing in. Not sure if these are only related to my phone,negative
skips...doesnt show time on small screen have to reload...,negative
"Hello. Im experiencing an issue where when I play any songs, it will only play for a few seconds and then pause. Afterwards the apps will freeze and im unable to load any playlist afterwards.

I really enjoy a personalized oriented playlist i can put ALL the songs i enjoy into. Need more artists on this. I run programs everyday! LOVING IT! 5 stars for more 90/2000s music ðŸ˜‰ðŸ¦¸,positive
I love this app very much have used for more than 3 years the music is good but the podcasts are even better . I enjoy using this app it is the best music app l have ever used.,positive
"Worst music app, there are a number of ads as compared to songs. It's hard for me to understand whether I am listening to songs or Advertisement ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. Ratio of Songs: Advertisement 40%:60% Wanted to give 0 star but there isn't not a option I think",negative
It is good the songs are super collection,positive
"My app isn't opening for some reason, fix the bugs asap or I'll die for depression.",negative
"I can't dislike songs, I don't know if that's just because I can't find the button or what but I don't like some songs that end up in my daily mix, I also can't figure out how to remove specific songs from my downloaded daily mix. Also also the songs stutter 2henevr I'm using other apps, much prefer my old music app",negative
Best app for streaming the latest music hands down. If you have Spotify Duo you & your parter can create your own accounts & playlist for one small price. I absolutely love Spotify. Highly recommended.,positive
On time and always on point,positive
You can access all music that you like,positive
"The experience is wack. Terrible interface with zero to little flexibility. You can't even select multiple songs to play next. You have to add one after the other. There's no function to rewind {not everyone wants to manually touch the song progression} just restart. Generally just terrible. I was hoping having all the songs would be a benefit but... apparently, not all songs are on there. I almost forgot to mention the laggy updates...the one running currently is so unembarrassingly laggy ðŸ˜©.",negative
"App is broken. The play/current track bar doesnt show so when i play a song i camt pause it, or rewind or skip to mext song.",negative
"They really ought to update their UI. It's super outdated, not a lot of customization options for editing/sorting your playlists, audio quality can vary drastically sometimes. Other than that, the app is alright. It performs well for the most part.",positive
"Streams music and podcasts. Did you know? In its first year, iTunes had almost $70 million of legal Internet music sales (70 million songs at $0.99 per unit). This new way to download individual songs became a more attractive option compared to music piracy or purchasing a full CD, which posed the looming question...what would be defined as the basic unit of music consumption in the future?",negative
Very nice i can listen to all BTS music and also lyrics to say them ðŸ™‚ that's why 5 stars,positive
"Love Spotify but consistent with other reviews recently, the performance of the Android app has significantly deteoriated with it stopping through songs, not showing what is playing, randomly shutting down etc. Not a very good experience unfortunately from what used to be a great app.",negative
"I love Spotify,the songs are my favorite.",positive
This app is the best music and podcast app ever it might get a little touchy but is very reliable!!!!!!!!!,positive
"Everytime Spotify updates their UI, I want to shoot myself.",negative
Play bar keeps disappearing!,negative
I rate 1 star because there are too much of ads I know u want us to buy premium but there are too much of ads it annoys me that's why I am rating only 1 star,negative
Keeps randomly playing music by itself!,negative
I don't get my thirty minutes when they say it And too much ads,negative
"I can't change the play order from shuffle to in order when listening to an album. This is a seriously deficient app. Take a lesson from Garmin, the most user friendly company in the world, and no I do t work for them.",negative
"This app was good for a while until they added ads, also I try to play the playlist that i want to play but then I get random songs that I never put in my plalist its so annoying and needs to be fixed",negative

Very easy to use although their are some small bugs somthimes.,negative
pretty good. I just would like if you stop the ads.,positive
"Have been a fan and user for many years, but things are getting buggy lately, although my app is updated. The play/pause widget doesn't appear, so to stop listening, I have to exit the app. This means I can use a sleep timer. It also just spontaneously stops for no reason. And even as it's playing a song with 4G, sends me a popup that it can't play the song that I'm listening to... Frustratingly unreliable.",negative
This app is amazing.but the problem is were listening the music after the song ads will automatically play,negative
"It's only great if you have premium. Otherwise, you're flooded with ads.",negative
Hi to all of,positive
nice music and updated,positive
"Great personal selection, interesting how it knows",positive
It's a great place to get your podcast fix. Unless they start deleting episodes of Joe Rogan and then I'm out.,negative
Can you please fix the last releases bugs app is almost unusable in its current state Keeps jumping tracks or stopping playing Losing play button in the app so have to close it down and reload,negative
"Works great. Grab the paid version of you want more control. Free version has shuffle on by default and you can't turn it off. Other than screwing over the artists, it's a good app for the listener to use.",positive
"Nothing works. Works fine on PC and PS4, but not at all on mobile. Not exaggerating, it played 5 back-to-back ads before I closed the app. Can't shuffle anything, can't listen to a single song",negative
I love Spotify I will use this app for my music forever all the time 24/7 I don't care about the other apps this one is for me and I love it,positive
"I love Spotify for the service and features, but the app is such an absolute disgrace that I can't give it more than 1 star. Really, very poor UI that makes me think they actually don't do any kind of testing or research into what users want. Really, really bad.",negative
"Some of my music isn't playing. I don't know why. It is updated, and has internet connection at all times. I'm on premium so some of my songs are supposed to play offline but they also aren't.",negative
Excellent application,positive
Such a good platform of music.,positive
Im stuck at loading screen,negative
"Back to one frkng star. First of all there's the ""Spotify is trying to play"" notification bug. But the very worst of it all: WHERE IS THE HIFI you promised!??!?!?!? Also, I was keen to try out several playlists only to find out you've completely changed the layout regarding the playlists recently. Quit your standard arrogant text regarding new updates on Play Store and get your @!!â‚©%â—‹Â°@$ together. Your main strenght was reliability, but it seems you can't keep up with that anymore. Such a shame",negative
Mind blowing,positive
You don't provide count of no. of songs in the playlist.,negative
"I can't say enough good things about Spotify. Amazing value, and I get to share my family plan account with up to 5 members of my household? Easily the best streaming service available for people who live musical lives and enjoy the ability to take deep dives back into the past works and discographies from some of the best artists from any era.",positive
"lyrics don't appear on my phone. The app is up to date but still nothing :( Edit: today I opened up the app and there was an ""announcement"" about the lyrics. I was excited about it, but a second later was disappointed again: no lyrics for. Updated the app but it didn't do anything. Edit 2: uninstalled and reinstalled the app on my phone, the lyrics thing appears on the songs in the library, but doesn't work at all â˜¹ï¸ I pay for this and shouldn't be having this problem",negative
It's Spotify. Just get it.,positive
It's awesome feeling Spotify plays according my choice of songs.,positive
What the hack Spotify?! Why I can only invite family member to my account living on the same address!? Why the hell I would need so many devices on one address?! What a stupid decision to change the policy,negative
If you have a Playlist with 400 songs it only plays a 1/4 of the songs over and over,negative
"as a non premium user, this app just unnecessary playing ""suggested song"" that ive never want to hear and when i just started to play one playlist and then most of the songs didnt even IN the playlist so I need to skip that songs, but guess what? u cant skip more than 6 times. Its not just that, when the ad said im gonna get 30 min without ads and then theres ads... oh theres Mercedes/spotify premium ad ALWAYS pop up recently, so annoying.",negative

UPDATE: Thank you for promptly fixing the play bar! Exactly why this is the best music streaming app!,positive
Toooooo tooo tooooo many ads after a single song I'm just gonna download the crack version of this tho... Not fit to donwload,negative
It's a app for listening to music. It gives you custom playlists and notifies you of new songs from your favorite artist. I like it,positive
"Sad because of blatant censorship. My podcast episodes with the COVID ""warning"" on them, crash the program. So effectively I cannot listen to any podcasts that do not fit the narrative.",negative
"Great app! But it keeps playing different songs everytime I play a specific song. Honestly, it ruined the whole experience for me. Deleting this app until they make some changes.",negative
1 start for,positive
"I use Spotify almost daily. However lately it refuses to play several podcasts that I listen to. I've closed the app, I've restarted my phone. Nothing works. I can't listen to the podcast on the Spotify website because it just redirects me to the app.",negative
"For Music, you can't beat Spotify. But for podcasts, it's beginning to get ridiculous. Before April 2022 there were very few ads while listening. The ads were at the front of a podcast so you could listen without interruption. I'm not saying ads are bad, but now, there are a minimum of 3 ads or more every 10 minutes! Why do the ads just pop out randomly?! A 30 min podcast has at least 6-8 in it. WHY ?!",negative
Love this have been using for 5+ years but could not enjoy without the subscription,positive
I am music lover. Spotify gives me great experience and suggestions ðŸŽ§,positive
Even after the new update it keeps rejecting my card for Spotify premium,negative
Worse music app I have ever had in my existence you can only have 6 skips per hour and can't even choose what song you want to listen to its really bad I will change my mind on the app and say it's good when your able to pick what song you wanna listen too,positive
"Great for the most part, but when attempting to sync with other devices - be that a computer, smart home device or similar the interface both lags and sometimes stops working altogether on the mobile app - requiring to force restart the mobile app to get it to re-sync.",negative
Awesome can find almost all your favourite artists,positive
it is good so far but for some of the songs the are playing and cant hear anything or it play half of the song too.try fix that do it is annoying,negative
"Spotify is a great app for listening music, the best. But podcasts, oh man, it terrible. Yeah, it got ton of exclusive podcasts but podcast section of app really messy and a hassle to operate. Please add a separate section dedicated to podcasts or just launch a separate app for just podcasts. Because honestly, I cant listen to Spotify exclusives on another apps and I dont want to listen to them on Spotify. Its a loss-loss situation for me.",negative
Why is this so hard to play what I want I just wanted to hear my forevet song please fix it I want to play songs I want but it won't let me it just moved to a another song please fix it,negative
I watched an ad on this application on 5:15 AM which was supposed to give me 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening. At exact 5:19 AM I get another advertisement. What?,negative
"To all the people tryna complain about ads, don't buy a Starbucks (or fastfood, that extra snack, etc) tomorrow. Now pay for premium which you will enjoy for longer. Repeat every month. Enjoy life. I'm willing to bet half of y'all pay ~80 for a tv box a month, which you rarely use. If music is part of your daily routine, pay for premium. It's worth it.",negative
"Gambling ads, interrupted by music. Australia has a gambling problem, but spotify have no issues feeding into this with 2/3 ads played and sometimes 3/3 ads played being for gambling. But hey, as long as you get ad revenue, who cares, right?",negative
It used to be good but now its rubbish. I can't even play a single song I have to watch on shuffle and when the song I want to listen to is over I can't play it again and have to listen to other random songs it's so annoying and hope in a future update they let you listen to single song,negative
Spotify is great for finding music related to searched artist and saved music.,positive
"The new update broke app, please roll it back. I'm paying for premium.",negative
The app is the worst thing. Keeps crashing and stops working on its own whim.,negative
"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. They force lgbtq propaganda and dont allow you any way to block or even not see content youre not interested in. It doesnt matter what you enjoy they just want to push theyre small minded brainwashing podcasts that tell you not to think. Until this app is about the music and podcasts you actually enjoy, DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.",negative
music doesn't download when I'm on cellular data. it just keeps rolling and this has been happening for over a month now. I can only use wi-fi to download }:â€‘|,negative
I happy well for Spotify,positive
Amazing content and sound delivery.,positive
Excellent for recommendations! Has exposed me to many different bands that I didn't even know existed :),positive
"A few UI changes need to be made, more bugs need to be fixed and a few network issues still need to be addressed. Overall a pretty good app except they of course need to pay artists more for THEIR work.",positive
Will stay the best music app forever!,positive
awesome access to tunes however continuous disconnection to Samsung Galaxy phones. On my 2nd one and repeatably days no internet connect. Have reinstalled. Cleared cache. Very annoying.,negative
Spotify premium is the best.,positive
My favorite way of listening to music,positive

I cant even go to options or something without the app crashing what the heck,negative
"Only useful for background play,Can't choose what song you want to listen to without premium or replay a song.",negative

Outstanding and best of the songs i love it,positive
Its a great app has lots of songs i can listwn to music while bwing on a another app,positive
It's great for listening to your favorite artists,positive
This apps is so very nice ,positive
Every time I click a song I want to play it plays something totally different and unrelated and something I don't even like. Even YouTube music doesn't do that.,negative
Its very good its just that you guys removed the feature were we can see the songs and now we can only see the names and I hate how the shuffle button is with like the play button I am not saying it's bad but I would like it to be back it's fine if not since it's not that big of a Problem,positive
1  star fortis because premium adds,positive
Love Spotify! I never have any issues! My favorite music platform!,positive
IT'S AMAZING!! the adds are a little ridiculous though like bro I'm listening to my jam and u have to interrupted,positive

After updating app become worst. If I am selecting song but playing something different song..,negative

Latest update is really buggy on Android. It keeps disconnecting and it doesnt show on a locked screen quite often. Spotify is the best music streaming app out there,positive
Best music streaming service I have ever used. UI is simple and sophisticated. Spotify also features many personalization options that makes the app feel like it was built for you.,positive
Really osam I like it I experianced and enjoy to explore the song,positive
"Free spotify tends to get more insidious the more you use it to frustrate you into paying for premium, to the point that it would play 2 songs then 3 ads repeatedly",negative
Average. It bugs out so often it's hard to use and makes me not want to use it at all.,negative
I love this app I would recommend this 10 out of 10 to anybody. I don't even have premium and I don't get ads that much and Spotify is just really good.,positive
There's a crash sometimes but not so often that it annoys me so everything's good!,positive
All other comparably services pale in comparison to spotify,negative
"It's great. Just wish you didn't have to pay the premium price just to choose what to listen to, but hey, still a great service.",positive

"I am not able to pay my subscription fees. Every time when I go for transaction, it showing fail.....please Spotify look into the matters asap, becoz I don't want to lose my music collection.",negative
Never works properly. Unable to pause or even let a song/podcast play. Have had issues and developers get back to me with no working solution. Have to update every 2 days. They won't even offer me a discount. This is why Monopolies are illegal. Samsung Z Flip 3. Stuck with them I guessðŸ‘Ž,negative
"Hi, I'm old Spotify user and I genuinely love this app. They provide you best quality addvertisements and they sometimes roast themselves so if you're having a breakdown at 2:34am listening to your fav song, they're just gonna roast themselves and make you laugh. Sometimes it's annoying when songs comes in between when I vibe on adds at my terrace but it's manageable. I thought about purchasing Spotify premium but I bought apple music cause it feels illegal to buy Spotify premium as a brown guy",positive

Listening to songs on sportify has been very excellent and amusing My first ever online music application And I hope it continues,positive
"Newest update makes the app crash all the time. I can't even use it on my phone efficiently anymore and it's just sad when I pay a subscription every month for good music service. Oh, my ""Wrapped 2021"" still isn't fixed either even after talking to their IT for ages",negative

Two average-length songs and more commercials. I'm actually keeping track. TWO songs. Not even TV is proportionate in it's commercial to viewing ratio.,negative

"This app was honestly great but there are to many adds. The adds last for so long and it can be really annoying when I put on music while I sleep. It's also quite sad how I can't even click to listen to my song from the liked list. It just gives me like a 10 second trailer of the song. In order to actually listen to it, you have to search it up.. so in order to actually enjoy your music, you pay for premium.",negative

The restrictions placed on the mobile app that aren't present on desktop are frustrating.,negative

How do I listen to music offline I've tried to download podcast and it's doesn't give me what I need I need an app to listen offline using Spotify,negative
"When ask Google Assistant to play a song, even tho the search result is correct in Assistant, Spotify plays the wrong song version. Eg: Play the song ""The Hills"" by the Weeknd, Spotify plays The Hills Remix",negative
Just too much of advertisement. Which gets irritable.,negative
"The leader in its field, top quality app.",positive
App automatically close,negative
"Music keeps playing without me turning it on, then when I go to the app it appears like nothing is playing although it IS playing. The only fix is to swipe the app away and reopen. Seems to happen more with Bluetooth",negative
Great app best music streaming app out there does everything I want at a great price .,positive
Great selections and very easy to use,positive
1 star because developers refuse to fix the bluetooth autoplay feature. If the app is closed NOTHING should play... EVER! It doesn't matter If it is connected to Bluetooth or not. Amazon Music doesn't do this. Pandora doesn't do this. Only Spotify doest this. Why is that? Are your developers graduates of community college? Or maybe not graduates at all?,negative
Get better at bugs but your alright for the meantime,positive
It shuffles into other song instead of the song I'm looking for,negative
Next update will be probably like if you want to listen hit songs then purchase membership,positive
"Between ""downloads"" not actually being usable offline and then having to re-download the stuff that you weren't able to use in the first place (basically every other day so say goodbye to all your data) the premium version of this needs tons of work. I'm glad I only did the free trial as I wouldn't pay for this jankiness at any point. Do yourselves a favor, get YouTube premium. Downloads that actually work offline, And you don't have to re-download them every other day.",negative
"Love it, so easy to listen to your favourite songs!",positive
"Since your last update, I can't get ANY music to play. The ads, however, come through brilliantly ðŸ‘ Good job! Hope you know sarcasm when you hear it because I am disgusted with this whole thing. I have a feeling if I upgrade to premium and start giving you $ it would work. This is BS!!",negative
"So on my iphone 6 I wasn't able to buy Spotify premium, which was a bummer. But I really like it because it has good quality music. I just don't like it when I skip a song that it immediately jumps into and ad. Also that the adds are unskippable can be annoying. But nothing too serious. I like you guys. Keep it up! Also it's nice that you have remixes.",positive
App can be laggy sometimes. The search feature is not smart enough to predict what you're looking for. Most times you have to type in exactly what you're looking for.,negative
"A really good music house. Easy to use, no disruptions and fast.",positive
Best music app easy to use and smooth,positive
Spotify fix your mobile version of the app. It freaking sucks. I'm trying to listen to Garfield and friends and it plays something completely different. Like mf tomes the toot toot train. And I need to buy premium to have unlimited skips. Get the hell out a here. Why can't I just skip the songs as many times as I want Along with skipping the song to a certain time. SoundCloud is better I recommend getting that instead,negative
"Great app, continues to give great recommended songs on premium. Transitions feel professionaly mixed and premium is so worth it!",positive
"Somebody connected to my account with a different email and I had no access to my playlists or account and no help from spotify to rectify the problem, deleted the app...",negative
Great except for the app only constantly drags you if you don't have money to pay for it,negative
Amazing ðŸ‘ Tremendous experience of listening songs on Spotify.,positive
"Was good maybe a month ago, starting to become very buggy again. 3 times out of 5, the ""now playing"" bar at the bottom disappears and if you don't close and reopen the app it will eventually become completely unresponsive. We're paying a subscription fee, fix this asap",negative
Should give free premium would be very chill and pro gamer move thank,positive
"spotify is amazing but please add the option to reorder your playlists on the phone. It used to be there but now when I click edit playlist there's only an option to change the image, title, and description.",negative
"Playback of music and podcasts has been buggy lately. If I pick out something to listen to, there are moments where it stops and begins again every so often. Sometimes it just stops, and I have to physically press play (which only works sometimes). I've tried turning my phone on/off, and the Spotify app was only updated 3 days ago.",negative
"Plain and Simple my go to for music, I'm starting to check out the Podcasts and enjoying them.",positive
"No music bar so we can change song, pause it, fastforward... Never know what music is playing. Very bad update",negative
"Recently it started to crush every time I use it... It is not for the first time, even though I have pro account. Edit: Since I started to use it again, it is working very well!!",positive
"Excellent and comfortable, very stable.",positive
"Great service. Keep it up and dont listen to brandon, just tell him lets go.",positive
Its a very very bed app this app mathates chens with you thank you,positive
I purchased premium and for some reason the app went offline since then and I'm unable to login or play anything on it. Sad to see such poor performance specially after premium.,negative
I love spotify with how much songs there have and even new artists i like it where u can listen to a song while doing something on a another appp,positive
i have been thinking of getting premium but even if you dont its still an amaszing expeiriance,negative
"I love this service! Where else can you find all of your LPS and CDs, all on one service. I JUST LOVE IT!!",positive
"Before the latest update, I was really happy with this app but since then, the lyrics to a lot of songs haven't been loading. That's not helpful for my usage and I'm sad I can't sing along as easily as before anymore. I'd be glad if I'd be given an explanation and the problem was solved. Thank you in advance!",negative
"It's just nice to listen to music and not have it turn off when you ex out, but you have to pay for no adds which absolutely sucks ðŸ˜” therefore I m taking of 1 star",negative
Stutter issue when swiping between songs (A71),negative
Spotify is a really good app for music no ads and background music I would really recommend it you can't download music without a prescription with the prescription it gives you download music and twice better sounding quality I really recommend it. ðŸ‘,positive
"Great app! Cant believe it's 10 bucks to listen to any music in your life. Let's say life expectancy is 75 years. 75 by 12 for months by 10 for monthly fee comes out to $9000. A mp3 cost a buck and I dont know if they make cds anymore. I'll get the CD. The only downside is it's $15 or something, higher and you might like the other songs. Mp3s you could just buy the song you like of the album. 10 bucks is worth it. All seriousness aside, I wonder if any DJs used spotify for their entire session.",negative
Best best best song best app best quality best adds best premiums best every thing in this app.,positive
I am unable to login in it and i tried all accounts,negative
We were able to keep all our playlists when we changed phones and resubscribed with Spotify. It was a real bonus. We love the amount of music geared toward those easy listening and hip hop that we enjoy. Thank you very much for the good work!!! We are satisfied and happy to continue with Spotify.,positive
"I think spotify works great for what I need. However my only issue if the shuffle. I dont like that I have to pay in order to play my playlist in order. I think that should be a free feature. However, its understandable that you guys need a way to make money. I suggest that when using shuffle it plays all the songs in the random order with no repeats until the playlist is done. I jave a playlist with 30 songs but sometimes all I hear are the same 7 songs and its very frustrating. Thanks.",negative
"I'm on a 90 day trial through Samsung after Amazon raised the cost of their monthly unlimited subscription. After using Spotify for a week I decided to cancel Amazon and will subscribe to Spotify even though it will cost more than Amazon. Why? The app is intuitive and easy to use; the suggestions are terrific and I've found every song, symphony, opera and genre of music I've searched for. This has been due with how well designed the app is and comprehensive the music selection is.",positive
"Very clumsy interface. If one plays a song found through usrr search, there's no way to return to a previous list of songs. ""Radio"" and Spotify suggestion lists cannot be saaved. Good selection of music (better than YTMuzak Premium) although a bit light on 70-80 fusion & some classical (e.g., Philip Glass). Good sound fidelity.",negative
App is getting better with each update. Great job team.,positive
Podcasts becoming a nightmare. Trying to get rid of podcasts on this app is ridiculous. Stupid things are all over the home page. You can click not interested till you're blue in the face and I'll just keep throwing up more spam casts.,negative
"The fact that u can listen to your downloaded tracks in the Spotify app is very ery nice feature, i love it. Thank you Spotify! Best update ever!",positive
"Longtime user of Spotify and I love the service in general. This review is more about how the app interfaces with Google Wear products. Just got a new smartwatch and loaded up the app, i could use it just fine to play music on a speaker or my car, but every time I try to play music on the watch itself, it takes me to a bluetooth connection page. I have had several calls on the watch, so I know the audio works. I guess I'll be stuck waiting for an update for now.",negative
"Really good app, I love it!",positive
"Great app, it's my go to for music.",positive
Oh man! Lot of ads nowadays. It's like forcing us to buy premium. Music Podcast are all good. Nice songs suggestions. All good except for the whole bunch of ads.,positive
This is one of the top 3 best music apps!!! Just wish there were less ads.,positive
"Recharge option is not friendly. So, prepare to in lite version. Please update the payment method.",negative
"new update causing issues. playback bar at bottom disappears, playback audio drops constantly",negative
"of all the platforms, Spotify keeps to my hopes from the onset. integrations, bringing on artists plus keep their hard working developers happy. maybe? maybe they will someday help artists feel safe & collaborate like red bull music or small studios do. Shazam & lyrics for those of us who need to now focus on other things is so helpful. of course for djs mixcloud and SoundCloud and other simple tools rock. for just streaming, and inter channel relations, Spotify stays small and channels big.",positive
Has almost every song I have ever searched!,positive
Love being able to listen to music from the 1920s to the 2020s.,positive
Many of the problems with playback and crashes haven't happened recently.,negative
Wide range of music of quality sound,positive

Very Very nice music very very nice ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ‘ ðŸ‘ ðŸ˜€,positive
"If I want to play a specific song, it plays the whole playlist, which i find extremely annoying and it only let's me skip six songs an hour, so I'm stuck with the same playlistof songs even though i wanted tailored songs",negative
"Avoid the free version at all costs. They have gone to great lengths to make listening to specific songs impossible. Not only is there no way to turn off shuffle, but spotify will also add similar songs into the mix, forcing you to skip whenever these come on. That is rather annoying by itself, especially when driving or otherwise occupied, but in case that wasn't bad enough, there's of course also a limit on how many times you're able to skip. The design is openly hostile to the user, avoid it.",negative

I love it you get to listen to your fav song anytime,positive
"Great app. You pick a song, it shows you more in the same category. I love it!!!!!! However the last 2 times I've used it, I can't shut it off,. What is up with that. I hate having to shut my phone down to turn it off. Please fix!!!!! Not happyðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡",negative
"I can't give this 5 stars because they took one of my absolute favorites (planet net, by the subdigitals) off here completelyðŸ˜”. But i'll give 4 for everything else",positive
Best music on Spotify from Google play store on the future and friends and family you can find and injoy,positive
Superb app. Specially for searching songs,positive
It's straight forward everything is there. Although they should minimize the amount of ads there a lot!,positive
"I like spotify.it give me extravagant feeling when music that i want inside this application with a lyrics, it more enjoyable..",positive
well I think they need more podcasts for gaming but that is pretty good,positive
"Usually enjoy using the app, but tons of issues since update - can play, but can't pause, skip, etc. No bar showing to adjust. Please fix!",negative
It's pretty good but the onley thing that bugs me is that you have to pay for the skips and one other thing is that for your own music you can fast forward it but for the rest it's fantastic.,positive
"Been using it since 2 yrs worked just fine..and lately the App kept crashing and wouldn't start for days. Tried reinstalling and now I can't log in to my account, tried a 100 times. It just wouldn't work. Installed Spotify Lite, finally logged in, but guess what.. all my playlists, all the work of last 2 yrs.. GONE. Frustrating!!!",negative
The best music app. My absolute favorite!,positive
Works well. 30 minutes free of no ads by listening to only 2. All my favorite songs are on here!,positive
"App is Good, i just didn't liked it's widget. I would love if developers improve its widget's interface/layout, bcoz it looks so simple",positive
I liked it but it was stupid how I would make a playlist and it would add songs to it then whats the point of making my playlist,negative
Indias no 1 music world ,positive

The widget is inactive after closing the app,negative
"Terrible sound quality, noticably worse than any other streaming service I've used. I just switched over to the premium service from Amazon Music and this is a HUGE drop-off in sound quality, songs regularly skip and stutter even with a high quality Internet connection. I'm shocked at how poor the sound quality is, and I'm baffled by why this is a popular app.",negative
"I admit that this app was really good when the latest update wasnt there, goshhhh spotify why cant i play i song that i want, when i click a song from my playlist it will just play a preview of the song, ugh this app really suck. Your app spotify sucks now! You only want money! Only premium users can play what they want! Latest update suck! I hate it ugh!",negative
"Completely different from the web version, good sound quality yet any playlist song Is completely random and you have 6 daily skips, can't get around it by playing single songs too. Overall the app is O.K. but the pc/computer web version is way better than the app.",positive
This is the best music app I have ever had it has everything! you must get it!,positive
I love Spotify! I use it everyday,positive
"It's a really good app. I probably use Spotify every single day, though I only give 4 stars because I really would like the same features that are on computer, to be the same for mobile. I don't think it's quite fair, but I believe it'll get there one day.",positive
"Keeps crashing? I've been a dedicated Spotify user for years but for some reason everytime I scroll through my songs in my library to listen to and when I swipe more than once, it crashes and sends me back to my home screen. I deleted the app and reinstalled it, cleared my data and cache and it still does the same thing. If it keeps doing this it has to be on YOUR part. Please fix it or I'm movimg to a different streaming service.",negative
"After the update I cannot like songs or download songs and play lists... I have a galaxy note 8, I have been to the support page but there are no solutions to this problem... I used spotify everyday but ever since this problem I found myself using it less",negative
"I'm having problems nowadays with this app. Idk why but I can't listen to my music even if it is downloaded. It says that I need internet connection but it is already downloaded, any idea????",negative
Love it easy and keeping up with music bomb,positive
The app I didn't know I needed. Revolutionised music and podcasts.,negative
"Spotify used to be known for recommending good music, but lately all it does is recommend the same thirty songs over and over. The console version is riddled with bugs. Come on guys",negative
Absolutely love spotify.,positive
Worst applðŸ¤®ðŸ¤® I get ads after one song Please stop this app. It will be way better,negative

"edit: still can't preview songs, the queue is still messed up, plus the android widget isn't working after the last update and the link to make collaborative playlist just sends you to the main page",negative
New update comes with severe bugs. Does not show all my saved playlists anymore. Now it is even worse. Cannot play particular albums.,negative
"Enjoying it so far, but how can I select song or rather use song as a ring tone.",negative
Absolutely brilliant app who needs CDs when you've got Spotify,positive
"Awesome audio, great for when you are having a bad day. I love this app and you will too. (ãƒŽ^_^)ãƒŽ",positive
"When the app works, it's fantastic! For over two months I have only been able to listen to the app for a few hours before it will no longer pause, skip, show the correct information for what is playing, etc. I usually have to force stop the app and open it again or have to restart my phone completely. I'm a monthly subscriber and have been for over two years. I don't understand why this app can be so great one day then be complete trash for months after an update.",negative
Pretty good app overall can be a little slow sometimes like when I'm in the car it takes a while for songs to load when there downloaded and u have to have internet to look at the lyrics even if the song is down loaded ðŸ˜† lol,negative
Been having this app since 2017 best music app ,positive
It's really good it better than Pandora but it's hard with the shuffle stuff beside that it's great,positive
"It says 30mins of uninterrupted music, that's a lie. One star for lying.",negative
"Sometimes spotify gives me two songs with four ads but sometimes its nice to me, giving me a 30min ad free period, and when it does, it makes me happy, it honestly does deserve a 5 star rating, its led me to so many great songs and so many good playlists.",positive
All of my songs in one app! It's amazing! Spotify even chooses songs similar to the song I played,positive
No issues for me. Love being able to control music on my computer from this app on the phone!,positive
Spotify does a good job. ðŸ‘,positive
Awesome one word is all I'm going to use to describe this app,positive
This is a best song app,positive
"When some bugs get resolved, me ones surface. The amount of times I've had to uninstall and reinstall is ridiculous. The player comes on when it feels like it and I cannot pause anything that's on. Even when I've shut the app down, the track continues. Not sure if feedback will help. First time doing so",negative
"Subscriber still get ads and am forced on things I didn't want. Podcasts everywhere, in suggestions even if I never even once listened to any of this. App simply doesn't work well for something paid. Support is inexistent, and those threads for improvements are all taken for granted. There are many other better options to listen to music.",negative
Its a good app for music but the ads ðŸ˜… they are very annoying ðŸ˜¡ but I just bought a premium membership just a request give download option for free users,negative
"I can't play a song whatever way I want. I can't play one song at once and unless I get premium, I can't replay a song unless I play all the other songs on a playlist. It limits too much things.",negative
Nowadays I simply can't use the app in my cellphone. It just doesn't load or do anything. It almost looks like a dead app.,negative
Keeps my playlist for free thanks Spotify clash on man,positive
This app was working just fine and I was listening to my favourite songs and having a great time. Now the app just crashes whenever I play any song. Please resolve this issue asap,positive
I'm jealous ðŸ˜« of the producers they did too well great ðŸ‘ job keep it up,positive
Music plays for a short moment then stops. Then starts up hrs later and stops again.,negative
"I wish it had less commercials but other than that I love the sound, the quantity of music and artists. A pretty nice app.",positive
I  this app Is so easy to use any time The music  you can choose have different variety and fantastical The best app ever ,positive
"Spotify has stopped playing on my mobile device and keeps telling me no internet connection, despite having a good internet service. I hope it is rectified as I am already losing interest in the app.",negative
"I love Spotify...Every Artist I have ever looked for has been on this app, gives recommendations for similar music. I have been introduced to Artists I have not heard of and in turn expanded my musical taste.",positive
"It's an absolutely great app for listening to music, but only if you have time. This app is unreal if you don't have to wait for music, but if you have low service and a want to play your already downloaded music you're SOL, you're going to have to wait for service to play the music downloaded on your phone. This also applys if you're a service member without service overseas. You wont have access to your already downloaded to your phone music at all.",negative
Excellent at guessing what kind of music I'd like to hear next. Always a great listening experience.,positive
Pretty good. I do think the lists could be more same type of music. The pod casts are cool.,positive
Everything I need in a music app.,negative
App is full of bugs recently. Constantly can't see the play and pause button. Songs just stop playing for no reason. If it doesn't get act together I'm cancelling me due subscription. At the moment it's not worth the money.,negative
Very hard to use compared to other platforms,negative
"I'm not a fan of the Only 6 skips per hour thing for people like me who don't have premium lol But I like spotify, recommendations of songs are amazing too",positive
"Broken still. When starting a podcast it will play, but the option to pause, play, volume, etc will not be available. It's like it's not playing, but it is...",negative
You can't select songs and the app just shuffles the song. Need a premium to do that. Back then you still can select songs and skip for 6 times per hour. Capitalism at the shittest. The worst update.,negative
"This app is not compatible with Google Home devices with multiple users and accounts. Completely useless to have a family plan that never actually works to listen to different content on different devices, while logged into different accounts. Also: I cancelled my account last month, and still was charged again. I guess I have to get PayPal to intervene to get my refund. It sure would be nice if there were actually a simple way to access customer support.",negative
there awesome but the only thing that is not good is that you have to have data or internet so if your traveling and don't have data you can't play music.,negative
"I love you Spotify but u took away my favorite song, the song that hits my soul the most right nowðŸ˜­ðŸ¥ºðŸ˜­ I was so hoping you wouldn't monetize remix'..",positive
"Yes, like all, it's those constant ads. Initially it was 2 ads per 4 or 5 songs, then it was 2 ads per 2 or 3 songs. It was still fine. But now, its 3 ads per 2 or 3 songs and it's frustrating. Not all can afford or would like to take a premium. So kindly look after the ads. Apart from that I'd prefer spotify because it introduced me to different artist with the kind of music I listen to. Also, spotify streams means a lot to an artist's career as well. PS, stream Walls by Louis Tomlinson.",negative
The best free music application,positive
Excellent for a variety of great music,positive
I would give it five stars but the sound is a little off otherwise great selection of music and podcast!,negative
awesome ðŸ‘I love that I have daily mix songs for my taste.,positive

Now with some update I can't even choose what to lisson to on my own playlist, it just gives me a preview, I have to shuffle? What if like choosing what I lisson to on my own playlist? Why did you get rid of this option?! Or is it just me? Is there someway to change this? It made this app from greatness to garbage, I might just uninstall.",negative

Great app but really needs to bring back the lock screen widget.,negative
"It used to work fine now the interaction with car infotainment systems is wonky. If displays the info on the first song you play and doesn't change no matter what you're playing.

It's been over a month, can't you guys look into it already?",positive

This is best app in the world what an amazing app God bless the person how made the app the app has very sung ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,positive
Constant crashes with endless login problems. Now it has removed all my playlists and I have absolutely no idea what to do.

"This is by far one of the best apps. The ui is sleek, suggestions work great , my family has no problem with paying the relatively small cost of the family premium membership (which covers our 4 accounts), great music selection, I've started listening to some podcasts. And it is just overall a solid app. The only problem I have with it would be how much space its takes up, but with how much I use it that's worth it",positive
I definitely enjoy listening to the multitude of songs by the same artist in concession in addition to the other options that complement each song like highlighted lyrics. A nice arrangement which provides a pleasurable way to enjoy music ðŸŽ¶,positive
Great app premium really gives you allot and a great app to listen to music podcasts and more highly recommend,positive
You can play the music you love â¤ï¸ btr than radio it's only your choice,positive

Awesome music app. Spotify as everything I want to listen too.,positive
"I really enjoy using Spotify, the only thing is the ads. I'm okay with it and it's understandable that they need people to buy premium for income. But ya'll need to stop giving me ads after 2 songs cuz it's hard for me to listen to a ad in the middle of being depressed.",negative
"The now playing bar stopped working (OnePlus 6T), I will update my review if/when it gets fixed.",negative
"Dear Spotify! I understand that from time to time, you need to refresh the looks of this app. But since I am alive - 30 years - I used some sort of machine or program to play music. Every! Single! One of them! Has a the following order for the playback control buttons: previous track - play/pause - next track. Why on earth you think that giving me a huge playbutton, on the LEFT and putting the prev./next button next to each other and in the MIDDLE would improve my UX?!?!?!",negative
"Love Spotify have had it for over 3 years now, it's become a big part of my day to day being able to listen to music when ever I need it to make daily life just a bit better.",positive
"Amazing recommended artists, beautiful interface, easy to use...this app has blown me away. Puts Apple Music and YT Music to shame to be honest.",positive
Gave it a five because it was a nicely packaged application. I would never ever pay for this service and changed the rating because the company's corporate politics merit a zero.,negative
"Yo Spotify, everyone around me share their favorite lyrics in their Instagram story, and here I am after updating your app twice can't still use that feature, and also Spotify wrapped appeared to be really really late yk ;_;, dang I'm so disappointed to the point I uninstalled you green wifi, but good for you, I installed again ðŸ¤§ with all due respect I really appreciate if you get my account fixed. Have a good day ðŸ¥°",negative
It is the best music app I ever had.,positive
"Two Statements: PC version better, Not buying premium",negative
Good,positive
Plugged phone into car radio Great for driving interstate,negative
Best music you guys love it thank you,positive
This app is so good and it free not like other apps that you have to pay to listen to music,positive
Its nice,positive
Far too many ads. I guess they have to pay for those big contacts somehow...,negative
The best online music app evet and its free!!!,positive
Love the variety of music and all the podcasts and more choices available.,positive
I'm a malaysian user.the app is good for everything.But I only give 4 stars cause i think Spotify can provide more choice for the mobile payment method such as touch n go ewallet or shopee pay.thank you.,negative
The best music streaming,positive
"GET THE EXTRA BUTTONS OFF MY SCREEN! They cover the information to the content I'm interested in! WHY? For nearly 10 years the Spotify community has been begging for an explicit only filter. If you look at Spotify's own reasoning for having explicit content in the first place it's ""to present the song the way the artist intended."" Yet they daily force edited versions into my content. And right above where I'm typing this it says that Spotify is always changing. Just not for the better huh?",negative
Screw your premium I just want to listen to music,positive
"This app is 100% one that I cannot live without on my phone. If you have premium, your experience is highly enhanced and refined to your tastes. This is my favorite music app.",positive
"I can find any variety of music I like listening to. From oldies and modern to classical, movies and even a little Broadway .",positive
Very slow to launch the app. Using on samsung galaxy s10+ with Android 12.,negative
Only give 3 stars caz. of adds caz they says 30 min of uninterrupted music and adds comes after every music,negative
"Would've gave 5 stars if Spotify completely supported Joe Rogan's freedom of expression and didn't delete those 71 episodes. I'm not a fan of many of those guys either, but Rogan's podcast is supposed to be free speech/free thought and he should have total artistic control. Spotify has stood behind Rogan, which is good, but they should be completely hands off with no censorship whatsoever. Leave JRE alone.",negative
"i rly like this app, i love spotify. it expands my music taste and I just love that. my only (very small) problem is that I think they removed the feature to preview songs when you're like adding them and when it's recommended. yea that's all, overall, nice app !",positive
Please fix the app Cause when I look at my playlist I can't play them normally now I can only listen to them a little bit and you only need to shuffle play to actually listen to the song that you wanna hear please fix this A.S.A.P.,negative
"The app is good. I have been using it for a , year and it work smoothly. We have all kind of genres and language plus also audiobook where we can download them. Which is for free! I haven't use the premium site cause of some personal reasons. So , over all i recommended you guys to download this app",positive
"Spotify! This app is very useful, but there are too much of ads and I also need Spotify to improve and add one feature that we can arrange songs in a queue by our choice that's my wish and also to reduce some ads...",negative
It's the Best app and with the lyrics!,positive
Idea- your organization should make where it only shows ads after you run put of skips.,negative
"always a great experience. always great service, great options. not buggy, nicely integrated into my other devices... ðŸ™ŒðŸ¾ðŸ™ŒðŸ¾",positive
"New update pauses songs while listening on mobile and desktop for no reason (on wifi as well as data mode, doesn't matter at what quality).",negative
"Hey, a small suggestion - Add a new feature in which we can reorder or rearrange our playlist. Thank you.",positive
"Used to be a great app but the last year or 2 it's just gotten worse and more broken with every update Update: I have to close and reopen the app everytime I want to manually select a new song. Genuinely the buggiest app I've ever used hands down, and on an s22 no less. Massively disappointed. Will switch platforms as soon as there's another decent one",negative
"option to sort/group liked songs by genre, not appearing, tried everything the support executive told. Need sharing option for liked songs list too.",negative
I love to listen songs on spotify,positive
"Great music, current music and oldies as well. I enjoy it several times a week.",positive
Spotify keeps crashing. No good!!,negative
I hope you'll have the 'songs' where you can see all of the songs you've downloaded section so I don't have to make multiple playlist just to be able to play all of it.,positive
"i really love spotify, but i donâ€™t know why i donâ€™t have the lyrics:(",negative
All of my playlists disappeared after my phone updated. What the hell? It took me years to build those playlists. If I can't get them back I am canceling my subscription. Spotify has not been functioning the way it should for months and this is the last straw. I'm done.,negative
Worst podcast app available only reason I have it is for Rogan. I download podcasts so I can listen at work when I have no data unfortunately the app sucks so it can't figure out how to show me what I've downloaded without the internet. And now the app force closes when I skip ads. The moral of the story is if you don't pay it probably won't work,negative
Just a fancy UI. It is really annoying to use. Horrible UX I must say,negative
"All good, but would be better if we had option to add a whole artist to a playlist or to download a whole artist",negative
Horrible I can only use the app internationally for 14 days what kind of nonsense are you guys doing it makes no sense whatsoever because I don't live in the states or any big country I live on a small islands and because of that I can't stream music on my ps4 nonsense this is has to be some kind of joke if anyone could give me a good reason on why they would do this please let me know,negative
"I actually like it but earlier when i want to play a song on my playlist idk what just happened cause you can't pick what song you want,you can only play randomly.",negative
I am happy by listening songs with spotify,positive
"When music streaming app won't give you a one and only function that it supposed to be have. I mean, play a track that I want to play and instead of this it's shuffles all the time. This is whole new level of marketing, nice. You guys really lost user. Besides, ads is ok, only 6 track skip is ok, Can't play a previous song is ok but can't play a single track is WOW.",negative
I love this app its great for music and it's very easy to use I would recommend it,positive
It was great .. but the new version isn't showing what song is playing at the bottom. So I can't change it or anything. Tried logging out and on again.. idk,negative
Nice,positive
"Gives you the ability to listen to a plethora of music artists and genres. For a monthly subscription you can disable the advertisements. Good value for money, I'd reccomend this app.",positive
"It works well, and stores your music.",positive
"Spotify has helped me to enjoy music while dancing with my kids, working out, cooking and getting to sleep. Thank you!",positive
What's changed?? Used spotify for years and I have the spotify app on my Kenwood car hi fi... never had issues until last week now it wont connect to the car app I've updated Spotify and my head units firmware but just wont connect?? Anyone have any ideas please??,positive
Spotify is a very good App it has many languages for songs.... I love the quality of songs and app... Overall I loved the app very much....,positive
Excellent selection of favourite tracks,positive
The Joe Rogan Podcast is what brought me here at 1st. Explored the App and have been very satisfied with how it works. It makes competitive apps like Pan***a feel like garbage. I also enjoy how irrelevant artists self remove themselves from the service too!,negative
It would be the best the thing I don't like when I double tap the sound button the music starts automatically that mades me go angry but the features are the like all,positive
Thank you. For Spotify app i like the all song thank you,positive
Best music experience you can have,positive
I have downloaded this app just because this is sponsor of Pakistan cricket board. â¤ðŸ’šðŸ‡µðŸ‡° Love from Indian illegal occupied Kashmir.,negative
"Amazing and great! You get all different types of music, and you can share with friends and create podcasts and Playlists.",positive
Love the app and service but I'ma give it 1 star review simply because I have a shared playlist with a buddy and I constantly have the same users/bot adding music to the playlist. It's beyond annoying at this point and I can't remove the music or block the user and can't report it either since the verification code I receive from Spotify doesn't work....it's frustrating,negative
Great app. Just that so many content creators that are just reviewing content that I am actually looking for. Bothersome.,negative
"Mobile app has gotten really bad. Stops and starts, play button disappears",negative
"This gives me the ability to play any genre of music I choose and I can literally DJ on the go , love it",positive
I love all the music with no advertisements,positive
Awesome vibe...love how spotify create my Playlist by the music I enjoy,positive
this app is amazing ,positive
I put five stars but if I have any issues then I wont hesitate to come back and GLADLY set it at 4 again ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜‡,positive
First of all we listen to music in your Playlist and then you can't have the Playlist anymore. You can't choose your music from your Playlist to listen to,negative
I love your stories I'm literally addicted to them... It brings me back to my childhood when I use to watch Are You Afraid of the Dark and when I use to read Goosebumps book. I appreciate this podcast â¤ï¸,positive
"I love Spotify, even pay the monthly membership. My issue is that it will play a few songs then stop playing and crash. I'd hate to have to cancel my membership and use another music app. Please fix this bug. Sincerely, A former Amazon Music listener.",negative
Very easy to find the song of my choice..... ðŸ˜˜ Love this app.... it's quick and easy,positive
"Nice ,best app for music lovers",positive
"Access to a lot of good music. Also 30 minutes at a time, without commercials. I highly recommend this app.",positive
"Without paying, this app is miserable. WITH paying though... It's definitely worth subscribing to; it's easy to navigate and there are plenty of songs and artists to choose from.",positive
I can find whatever I'm looking for old or new music I love it when I get a reminder of a song long forgotten search and there it is ready to download forever in my library! I haven't turned on my TV months since the Olympics!,positive
It's a great app to use to listen to music and to meditate,positive
It's simple to use ......kinda confusing but it's awesome...think imma so get the hang of it ....don't think I can give it five â­s cause it's kinda complicated.... maybe ðŸ¤·ðŸ¾â€â™‚ï¸it's jus me . DnSpnG!!!,positive
"Now playing bar disappears often, Bluetooth connectivity with my vehicle doesn't relay or update current song/podcast playing. Had no issues whatsoever with previous phone(LG G6)",negative
Spotify has too much ad on a single song pls fix that ad .,negative
The only thing I don't like about it is that every single time I want to play music it says I have no internet so I have to delete it and download it again I hate that that's why there's I'm not giving a five stars but other than that it's pretty good,positive
Just the delay in the beginning but other than that it's a good app all around.,positive
Pretty good overall. Occasional glitches & other nuisances.,positive
The best music app by far thanks Spotify loving the app,positive
Love Spotify any music I want,positive
This is the app that is consistently getting worse with each new update. I'm a paid customer of Spotify I'm seriously considering switch to apple music 1.)App's startup time isn't optimised takes too long to open. 2.) It lags a lot for some reason. 3.)Also there is playback issue if I play something i can't see what's playing neither in the app nor in notification panel on Android 12 this is so weird. 4.)Also bottom navigation bar is not transparent with Android 10's gesture navigation.,negative
Listen to good music and old music,positive
The app constantly crashes. Sometimes the podcasts are not downloaded despite me downloading them before.,negative
I am having a problem in the search button when i tab the button it takes me to the home pageðŸ˜Ÿ,negative
Beautiful interface superior sound quality Absolutely love it,positive
I assume it gonna be fine though have not really tap into it this long.so I believe it gonna be stunning having it.,positive
I was a Pandora user for a long time but the interface on Spotify completely kills it!,negative
"The app is just so cool,smooth and user friendly..thank you for the Premium experience..",positive
Keeps crashing alot. Sometimes plays without the bar so I cannot skip or pause.,positive
"Did you once play music in your car and now every time you start your engine, it thinks you want to play that Playlist again? Even if it wasn't in use before starting the car? Do you want zero options in the app to stop thst auto play? Spotify is for you!",negative
Great,positive
The app works well for years until last month....the music plays for 3 mins and then stop and sometime only 5 seconds and then stop...I have closed app and open it again or change to some other tracks to continue but it doesn't work. And also have restart the phone for many times to fix but still cannot resolve.,negative
Awesome . but need to review some music. Especially from the Caribbean,negative
Lots of ads better listen to music on pc so there will be ads rarely and u don't need premium then â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €,negative
It's become my go to for podcasts & music ðŸ”¥ðŸ‘ðŸ”¥,positive
good,positive
Versitile and diverse. I love it for all the great music from my era.,positive
Best music apps so far....looking forwards on the 3d experience ðŸ˜,positive
Latest May update has caused issues with the controls. Going back and forward on tracks doesn't work in the app or on the lock screen 8/10 times. It's seriously frustrating to have to restart the app to get the controls to work. Please fix this ASAP,negative
With just a small monthly fee I'm able to get access to all the albums I've ever dreamed of listening to,positive
Enjoyed the excellent service,positive
Usually I love Spotify but now NONE of the lyrics load (are you removing this feature??) And it randomly turns off lately,negative
Playlist is not work. Please improve. It's not easy way to play favourite song.,negative
Loooong time user and Love this app. However last update really messed up my galaxy note 10+. No controls at bottom during playback and stops playing during notifications? Is there a setting I missed?,negative
No prolicing of content allows for a ton of misinformation to spew from Spotify podcasts. I'm looking to move my premium account to another platform.,negative
"Probably the worst app to listen to music, wayyyyyy to many ads, and you also only get 6 skips, Pandora is better",negative
"Hello Spotify Team, I am extremely satisfied with the app. It has all the features that a music lover would ever need. Undoubtedly it's the best music app but I think that, one more feature I think should be added is 'Sleep timer'. A sleep-timer option provided for every created playlist, is something that I was thinking about to make a request to add. I hope that you will consider my request and I apologise for the inconvenience. Thank you",negative
I love free music and the ads are not hard to deal with,negative
Overall my favorite music app. Since Last update though it's been randomly stopping play.,negative
It's a great app but you can't really choose the song you want to play and if you run out of so g that your playlist randomized it just gives you random song that you might not even like and then pretty much forces you to buy premium,negative
Too many problems to list. I'll stick with yutubemusic,negative
Excellent got all the music I like and so much more. Recommended,positive
I think its a good app. But its unfair that the program isnt that good as the one you pay,negative
"Overall, Spotify is a great app. I pay for premium and haven't regretted it. However, since the Apr 5th app, it regularly crashes, won't show me the current song playing, and I can't skip or play new music.",negative
It amazes me that an app like this can have four stars why do I have to connect online after I download an episode why do I have to use data to see in episode that I've already downloaded that seems to me like a bunch of BS. So I'm like you know this sucks is somebody that only has two gigs of data per month. I'm just starting to hate the internet sooner or later you'll be gone and you'll be forgotten and nobody will remember you but I don't remember the hate for your data usage,negative
not 5 stars cause its a pain to not be able to select your music in the phone unless you are premium and this refreins so much to reach further people but besides that its awesome,positive
"Idk why y'all decided to delete my review. Funny how the Bluetooth still won't connect and glitches and randomly pauses though. Very, very funny. Edit: not even a hour later and it's saying I don't internet when I clearly do",negative
The bugs are terrible. Can't pause the music that is currently playing. Songs will pause out of no where. And there's much more.,negative
See i have to give this app 4 stars but it dont need even 2 stars  have a great spotify journey,positive
Nice,positive
Keeps stopping. Then all of a sudden it will continue playing and doesn't let you pause or stop.,positive
Definitely one of the best music apps out there! I would also recommend to get Spotify premium definitely worth it no adds,positive
A great range of music and podcasts. I've never seen Spotify down. Worth the price of 2 mugs of coffee each month.,negative
Slow app and more ads,negative
Great,positive
New update broke the app. Can't see playlist insde folders,negative
Amazing. Very good music ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶.,positive
It refuses to connect to my mobile internet despite having data and being on a 4G network.,negative
"I do like this app a lot, loads of music, and if ur on a different device then a phone, it's quite nice to have. But its lack of a star is a problem I been having of late, the app would basically glitch out, or bug out in the middle of song (which I can't not handle) this is the second time I have to reinstall it due to it doing that, I know it's not my Bluetooth devices, I restarted, cleared my storage, still, bugging out. So I am trying to reinstalling it solution",negative
A lot of songs good mix always find band I'm looking for,positive
"There are albums, songs that are still not available here. But its all good. There is still room for improvement.",negative
Amazing!I've got my favorite songs old and new from A-Z completed. Thanks Spotify,positive
Best app... I just loved it... Giving five star....,positive
"Music stops randomly. Sometimes when I go into the app it does not display the music currently playing, making it impossible to pause the music.",negative
"Great app, I just wish they would bring back the option to pick the exact song you want to listen to and not have to wait through a shuffle of other songs, but other than that I would say it works amazing and I hope they keep improving the app",positive
Too many bugs/glitches that just doesn't make the experience worthwhile,negative
Now you cant choose your own song when you want to and when you make a playlist so you can it puts songs in and that is all you listen to and it cost 10 dollars a month so you can do all of that,negative
This app is very good I had payed premium then in offline period I can also listen music,positive
It says that if u watch a short ad it would give u 30 mins of interrupted listing but it gives ad every time a song end and its kind of annoyin to be honest 1/10 alot of people font have the money to buy the premium.,negative
Build is completely unstable. Player is broken beyond belief will randomly start playing music completely by itself.,negative
"A most desirable listening experience! I seek it's cozy, warm fuzzy embrace on a daily basis!",positive
Advertisments are repetitive,negative
As always!!! Spotify has a spectrum of music to satisfy any person's mood's,positive
Enjoy no commercials..love how it keeps track of what I play and makes me Playlists..,positive
Thanks for placing the play/ pause button controls back to it's original position!,positive
My experience has been great. The algorithm has been good with my taste of music and podcasts. I do not like the black background without the choice to change the color like other platforms. Hence the 4 stars. (Meant to be 3 stars cause the color is a bug to my eyes),negative
I like this app because so many songs are there when i am going to sleep that time i think to hear songs my favourite song i type and it will come,positive
"Pretty solid, but technical problems have started creeping in.",negative
My most used app. It is fantastic and I cannot get through even a single day without it. ðŸ˜Š,positive
Love this app. But yesterday when I tried streaming the songs it didn't play. When I switched from my wifi to mobile data. It started playing. Please fix this problem,negative
"PLEASE make playlists for podcasts where it will play the latest episodes of eg. three podcasts I have added to a playlist. Like in daily drive, but customisable!",negative
"I honestly hate the ads, on top of that, it is so weak that other apps can easily overtake this app. Also, some of my favourite songs were removed, I want them BacK on Spotify ðŸ’¢ðŸ˜¡",negative
Fine playing but can't download,positive
"Used to be able to listen to a sample of a song on the mobile app. Can't do that anymore. Also, when I search for stuff I'll click add nothing happens. I can't tell if something has gotten added. Then it immediately bounces to the search screen so I'm unable to add more from that particular artist or album. At this point I have to go back and search for the artist or album again to add a song. Adding a handful songs can be quite tedious.",negative
"New update same problems. Plays ok via Bluetooth in the car but when disconnected continues to play on phone. Play bar disappears and notification bar shows play button, but app is still playing. Only way to stop playback is to close app.",negative
"It would be better if it worked offline ðŸ˜’, I'm just saying.",negative
what does it mean First you say listen 30 minutes of uninterrupted music then after one song you advertise again It would be better if you don't say it that 30 minutes of uninterrupted music,negative
I love spotify the only thing about it that when i search the name of a song it gives me a full playlist but without that song,negative
To choose my like songs with the lyrics on the bottom of the screen is fantastic.,positive
cmon give me a break ads always pop when i listen to 2-4 music,positive
Simple and user-friendly,positive
"It is to restricting please change it, I tried playing my fav songs but it keeps playing different songs and you even need to get premium? How pathetic, I'm giving this app a 1 star it's to restricting!!ðŸ˜ ðŸ‘Ž",negative
Loving it. It's just what I have been looking for.,positive
the play bar at the bottom of the app keeps disappearing. can't see what's playing or pause/ play/skip without closing the app completely over and over until it works again.,negative
The premium can't purchase it's always error !!,negative
Love how you can build your own play list and play off line wouldn't be without it now,positive
Its definitely the best music app out there but recently for me at least the adds have become increasingly unbearable. The other day I had the same advert play 3 times in a row back to back and then 3 other adds after.,negative
"Tries so hard to take your money by playing ads and only allowing to skip a few times, you are better off using youtubedl and VLC",negative
I love this app I wish they had discounts for military. I would get a subscription if they did. I use the free way right now but I do enjoy Spotify. I have try all the other but this one is my favorite,positive
NICE,positive
So easy to use Love this app,positive
Wonderful application. Best app for listen all song in all languages . Very good quality songs. I love to use Spotify. I hope Spotify reply to me!!!,positive
Login troubleshooting has some unnecessary redundancies.,negative
I can listen to all my fav songs And podcasts,positive
Love this app.It runs on slow internet or in less internet .THANK YOU for this awesome app.,positive
"Great app for music but missing so many tracks from so many artists and gives preference to iOS devices for updates and features, appreciate if swipe to queue feature is rolled out soon enough, as the iOS users have been enjoying this feature since years.",negative
I have the right number of times but the spotify,positive
Excellent,positive
This app was one of my favorites but now I can't see the songs in it and I can do only 6 skips per hour now. I recommend that they put their older version back and allow unlimited skips per an hour.,negative
Amazing! I'm able to replay my favorite songs,positive
A complete app for collection if favourite songs,positive
Playback bar doesn't show up at the bottom when something is playing for some reason. If it doesn't pop up audio randomly stops. If the bar does pop up I have no issues but it's not showing up more and more frequently,negative
Very easy and nice listening,positive
Best thing for hearing,positive
Spotify is one of the good app for listening music.. But suggestion of the next song is not based on my previous/similar intrest.. Hence you have to work on the Artificial Intelligence & Machine learning so that similar songs can be suggested to the music lovers.. Just check on the YouTube how they are suggesting the similar songs..,negative
I love Spotify its just sometimes when I want to play a song It will bring um an album that's kind of anoying but I've all love the app,positive
This app is terrible for free users honestly I can end it all here. For free users you can't freely choose the songs you want to listen too not skip not even and there will be an ad every 2-3 songs in. That said there is still a wide range of music available I like it's recommendation algorithms. So overall it's still a very solid app but only if you want to buy premium.,negative
Best music app ever made.,positive
Great app! Lots of music I love to hear creation of playlists are very easy to do... now I can hear all my favourites everyday! Highly recommended!â­â­â­â­â­,positive
"It's a very good app for music lisners, but I think you should add a lyric translator also in this app to understand lyrics of different languages ðŸ™„ðŸ™ðŸ»ðŸ’œ",positive
I don't want your recommend songs. And why do we get 6 skips an hour! It's like so annoying. Worst ever.,negative
Best music app I love that you could go to any app while playing music,positive
I'll give you more stars when you quit screwing over Tom McDonald!,positive
"I love Spotify and the app is so Good. I do have premium so IDK how the experience is without it. Only thing that would be cool, if we could download lyrics...",positive
Pls Add Hindi film album No one killed Jessica.. Overall good app to listen songs .Keep it up.,positive
I love the fact that there is roughly 1300 different music genres world wide. And that because of apps like this it's all accessible to everyone and anyone who wants to listen. Beautiful !!!! ðŸ˜ŠðŸŽ¼ðŸŽ¶ðŸ’¿ðŸŽ¸ðŸ¥ðŸŽºðŸ”£ðŸ˜Š,positive
Amazing no problems at all with spotify,positive
What the hell happened? It feelS like every other update creates a tonne of bugs. Play controls keep disappearing and audio will randomly start playing out of no where. Don't even get me started on the ads during podcasts even when I'm paying for a sub. I understand you payed a metric boatload for Joe Rogan but I don't even like him and don't understand why I have to pay for that contract with a bunch of ads. Really sad to see what's happened...,negative
Good ya,positive
Great platform have to say. Wasn't a fan to start but really has made a difference to how I listen to music,positive
My Spotify is not working its not opening after may updates toðŸ’”,negative
Nice app Specially for playlists.,positive
"The app is straight up broken and not showing any of my playlists or allowing me to play songs. I updated it, and it's not my phone, so they didn't fix it for tons of us who haven't been able to use it",negative
Great music app. Only issue with it is that it sometimes stops. I have close it down and reopen it but this doesn't happen very often.,negative
spotify is so good it has really good music on,positive
Good music app,positive
"I had problems soon after installing the app. It seems impossible to shut it off completely. I was trying to travel using the Waze app for navigation. Spotify kept playing music unexpectedly interfering with my trip. The only quick solution was uninstall it, so I could safely travel using Waze as intended.",negative
It's nice but when i click on a song it plays a different song it just so annoying sometimes can you please fix it,negative
Easy to navigate. Not too many ads.,positive
Great platform but app is bugging out. Won't show music that is being cast and has been freezing up.,negative
"I wanted to update my review, because after a small rough patch, Spotify has evolved in to the best music platform under the sun. It runs smoothly 100% of the time making it the most dependable app I've personally used. The addition of song lyrics was the icing on the cake. It has been a pleasure to be a premium user. Stellar work Spotify team, truly amazing.",positive
"Needs more sorting options. So easy to add, why not?",negative
Stop asking me to enable Bluetooth everytime I open the app!,negative
"In 4g it is working well but when connected to wifi it says no internet connection, specifically while searching songs. Experiencing this issue for the last 2 to 3 months. Device: Samsung A52 4g. PS: wifi has a good signal, done resetting app data, and cache, logged out and logged in, restarted the device,.. but nothing seems to fix this issue.",negative
Brilliant,positive
"It was fine for a few months. But after it updated, I couldn't choose the songs I want and can't skip it whenever I want. It also lags alot whenever I go to an artist's profile and when I want to unpause. Please fix these problems because they are getting a little bit anoying, I would give it a 5 star but it's not going so well with me so 4 stars for now",negative
"Spotify plays whatever they want to play not what you select. I like the ability to create playlists, but the selection process is a problem.",negative
I love it,positive
"Love it, been using this app for a few years now. I originally started on pandora but spotify has pulled ahead as far as updates and overall function. My favorite part is at the end of every year it gives a summary of all the music/podcasts you listened to. I spent over 137,000 minutes listening ðŸ˜‚",positive
"Spotify is great, I mainly use it to listen to the JRE podcast",positive
Loved the premium version  And its very decent,positive
PREMIUM USER: Please if I purchase a premium plan don't show more ads!!,negative
Always love the algorithms,positive
It's a really nice app for any song i love it there is alot of songs same like YouTube . I like it,positive
"app has became buggy in the past period, casting doesnt work with my HK citation 200 while with other apps it connect directly.",negative
The Worst app if u don't have premium Spotify :/,negative
Why do shuffle have preview of songs that I already add to my Playlist it just doesn't make sense I've Been trying to play one fricken song for the past hour but it just keeps playin a preview of da songðŸ¥²:(,negative
Every time they update this app it gets progressively worse and less intuitive to use.,negative
"My name is Shamilla. I'm from Nairobi. The daily mixes are extraterrestrial and ingeniously predictive! I cannot wait, for how the said performance/experience will progress, 10 years to come (with more AI and hardware capabilities!!!)!!! The staff are prompt too when consulted for help. 5 stars, with 7 exclamation marks for you guys! 8 exclamation marks.",positive
Qhenni just got the app i got all free skips but a few qeeks later that changed and nowni have to pay for that and pnly 6 skips an hour really evan pandora has more skips than thay like really do better,negative
"Its a pretty good app, only problems are that without premium I have to watch a playlist and can't choose the song I want to listen to and I only have 6 skips an hour and Spotify would sometimes add songs they think I like to the playlists I made and I would waste all of my skips on them please make it better and fix these problems for other users.",negative
I've not had any problems . Couldn't ask for a better music app.,positive
It is a good app I love it but it needs more variety more music more american pop more music,positive
The songs will stop at middle while listening music.I am not satisfied by this app,negative
I use the free version. Ads are reasonable and infrequent.,negative
It's great and wonderful using Spotify! I love and recommend it! May God bless the developer!,positive
"Very pleased with the ""free"" version of Spotify.",positive
Easy way to listen to all my favs,positive
I love this appðŸ˜˜. But songs doesn't play in order. It's a very annoying.,negative
"Better for listening to podcasts than music as none of the adverts are skippable and you can't go forward or backwards when listening to songs without Premium. Also 2 criticisms with the shuffle system: 1) good luck listening to newly added songs and 2) when listening to liked songs, I expect to listen to songs in that playlist, not something that's 'suggested' even though I've never heard of the artist and their music is completely different to what I usually listen to.",positive
Please enable the capability of clicking on music labels within the credits.,positive
Best app for Podcast. Nice job Spotify.,positive
"I love it. Huge songs collection of any style music. High quality files and amazing softwere detecting the sound you like and giving you good recommended music for your preferances. App organised really well, it is a pleasure to use it. So thankful that Spotify exists and evolves.",positive
I've been using spotify premium for years and liked it but recently it simply wouldn't start very often and I have to reinstall it several times a week,negative
"I had Spotify for years now and I was always very happy with it. Now for the first time in my life I have Spotify without premium and it is the biggest piece of s*** I have ever encountered. I would give it 0 stars or less, but with premium it is actually very good so two stars.",positive
It super good and have alot of good micus,positive
"Awesome collection, quality audio.",positive
"Used to be good, now it's meh... Used to be able to use local stored songs in offline, but now it still stops and skips if internet is lost despite in ""offline mode"" and songs stored locally .... + The app recently started just closing mid playing .. + I can get the app to close when I want it too, but have to ""Force close"" it..... ... It even started playing without any open interface, impossible to stop... only Forced close worked ... Keep it up and I'll soon be looking for a better service.",negative
"Spotify won't play the songs that I want to play, or are in the play list I'm playing it just plays random songs, other wise it's pretty good.",positive
Good app to listen to music and podcast :),positive
It's really good for listening to music and I love the mode where it brings up the lyrics. Personally I like using it on my computer because you can pick wich song you want to play and it doesn't play your playlist randomly like how it is on phone.,positive
Excellent streaming service,positive
"The update on the 28th broke the app on my phone. Can't follow progress, won't work with Bluetooth and frequently auto stops podcasts or music.",negative
"Even when you pay it's garbage. Songs stop frequently, I'll be listening to a song and when i walk away and come back it's paused. Cleared out cache and uninstalled/reinstalled but nope. Still pauses at least twice every song. As I'm typing this my song has stopped twice. Not to mention the insistence to connect to Bluetooth share or something. Not happening. Give me an option to never see that pop up ever again.",negative
"absolutely amazing but please get rid of the ""playing suggested song"" thing. lots of people find it irritating that they have to skip 5 songs just to listen to the song they wanted. it isn't that hard to just play the song they clicked on",negative
Got spotify premium to listen songs offline .... bt for that i have download them everyday ... really fedup of that,positive
"Very difficult to search, ux is not intuitive. Apps do not remember last played tracks and do not sync among different devices - desktop and mobile.",negative
I couldn't open my acc if i sign up it's always incorrect password even though I know it's right,negative
"I'm started using spotify long time ago.It's very supportive app.I'm giving 5 stars.Because,Once i tired of a playlist there're lot more to listen everytime.Everyday listening to New,trending songs is my favorite hobby now.Thanks to spotify. â¤ï¸",positive
Not instling the a Pp,positive
"great service, easy to use and tons of music to play!",positive
Great selection with amazing Playlist builds have noticed however previously available comtent is no longer viewable or not easily found,positive
Full and full add only play. Worst app. Don't use it..,negative
After bought premium for students not activated the plan on my account.,negative
I am removing this app due to the company allowing misinformation to remain on your platform. When given the choice to be part of the solution you chose the dark side. I will encourage others to do the same.,negative
"I paid premium yet I'm always shown podcasts that I'm not interested in. It's annoying and gets on my nerves everytime, shouldn't premium accounts be ads-free? Now kust waiting out to end the premium account, will be switching to apple music.",negative
"Great app, easy to use,.never any problems",positive
Buggies app for the past 3 years. Can never stay consistent in operations throughout updates,negative
"The app doesn't even work, as it doesn't allow me to listen to the music I want to listen to, but instead makes me listen to random songs I've never heard before. Most terrible and useless app I have ever seen. And on top of all of this, they prevent you from doing things such as skipping more than six times per hour, and puting songs on repeat, unless of course you're willing to pay. You've lost a user, since money is obviously more important to you than user convinience.",negative
ita good app,positive
"good all music, the best of all best no ads..to skip",positive
Fantastic,positive
"Spotify is literally the best music streaming app, I've never had any problems with Spotify, it works perfectly fine on my PS4 and phone, I use Spotify every single day, love this app.",positive
It's a great app but I don't like how u add songs to playlists and sometimes I don't like the songs so that's why I gave 4 stars but apart from that it's an amazing app with different types of songs!,positive
I love this app but after about a month of using it there was more adds. And you also couldn't pick just one song to listen to you had listen to an entire playlist all though i like because you can make your own playlist with all your favorite songs on it and you can pick from different types of playlists,positive
It is a great app for listening music.But I hate the thing that we can listen the song but we can't download them and the ads are so frustrating. I hate these thing about it if you can do something so please but if you can't I will uninstall it.ðŸ˜  Thank You.,negative
"On my s20 fe , the app loves to disengage activity on bluetooth with my ford sync making me have to end the app through settings with force stop. Music will play and become unchangeable in the app or from my car as well as when I disconnect (getting out of my truck) it will endlessly play on the phone until I do so. I used to love the feature of it having a widget on my lock screen and my drop down menu but for some reason it doesn't exist anymore, at least on my phone. Idk, been here since 2016",negative
Fantastic music app and probablythe best,positive
"Everything's very fine, but there are alot of ads for those who don't have Premium. Two songs and again ads. So umm, make it a little less? :)",negative
SONGGS ,positive
This app is making me happy so i can play well the song plays,positive
Stops playing at random. So many bugs.,negative
Pay for the family account and still only one person can use it.... pointless and waste of money And it has a mind of its own. Works on its own accord.. apple music is cheaper and you get a family package!,negative
Very best music ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ app I love it ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—,positive
"Pc version which I used on a tablet was absolutely amazing but the mobile version is dogshit, can't even pick a specific song to play and I can only skip 6 times? Retared system which makes me want to drink bleach.",negative
I love the app but I hate that they add random songs it is sooooo annoying.,negative
"Love Spotify but since the last update am unable to view the song playing or pause, due to the mini controller now not visible the only way to stop the song in to force close the app. Please sort this as I really enjoy the App",negative
Not brilliant experience. Can stomach the adverts but get right p****d off having suggestions foisted into my playlist that I didn't ask for or want,negative
Fantastic aap every time new music for listening,positive
Worst experience. Because of irritating ads. After playing 1 song so many ads. Spotify is not a music app. Spotify is a ads app,negative
"New update has ruined the app, im unable to skip songs anymore and can't even see what songs playing... don't understand, hope it's fixed soon.",negative
Love how it finds other songs that are in the same Era and adds them To my Playlist,positive
"Seamless Straightforward, simple, and fun. Best.",positive
"This is meant to be a music streaming platform, but has become a mouthpiece for conspiracies & misinformation at a time when the world needs truth more than ever. I am so disappointed that Spotify - a company I once respected - has chosen profit over truth that I will be deleting my account. Corporate social responsibility is a real thing and companies that ignore the concept shouldn't be rewarded.",negative
Very glitchy lately periodically turns off then turns back on,negative
You cant go into your playlist and play songs in order like you could before now you HAVE to litaen to it shuffled,negative
"Isn't the premium plan supposed to allow the user to download music for offline listening? Well, when I'm driving thru areas with no reception (I drive through the montains almost every day) I can't access my library of downloaded content because there is no signal ðŸ˜‚, also, sometimes I have to force stop the app and even my phone (s21 ultra) because the app gets so glitchy ðŸ‘Ž.",negative
Lovely choices on music,positive
"Hate this app. I have Spotify premium and it's a good service, but the app SUCKS. Especially for podcasts... the UI is bad, and I want to dismiss suggestions. There's podcasts that are always on my home page that I will never listen to, and I can't make them go away. Seriously poor app.",negative
Good,positive
The music is great and I love the made for you playlists. But the app always seems to qlitch lately. Sometimes it won't play through Android auto. It randomly stops playing and im always having to uninstall and reinstall the app,negative
Tbh I want to give 5 for experience but as for the play list discover weekly it never seems to update on time and never has songs that are based on your interests,negative
It is so great we can listen to any songs,positive
"It crashes after playing a few songs so uninstalled and reinstalled it and now, it just plainly crashes whenever I open it. I don't want my money to go to waste bc it's been 2 weeks and I still can't use the app.",negative
"There are no downloads and still takes 6.5 GB. DO YOU USE STORAGE FOR LIKING PLAYLISTS? The only way to remove this problem is to delete all DATA (Not just cache) that includes deleting the account. Why would I want to do that? There's not even enough space for an updation. PREMIUM EXPERIENCE IS GOOD hence the 2 stars, but it hinders other activities on the device. DELETING CACHE NEVER HELPS HERE. This is my first and last trial of spotify premium. Also, TERRIBLE shuffles and discoveries.",negative
Can you explain the limit of 4 pinned playlists? It makes no sense.. I have tens of playlists and i want 6 or 7 pinned on top! Why just 4?! ðŸ˜¡,negative
Js buy premium innit,positive
The annoying back to back ads just spoils the whole mood.,negative
wth.. 2 ads was tolerable but 5??,negative
"I switched from Tidal this month after being there for 4 years. This App is far better. I like the Crossfade Option and on the Playlists it doesn't play the same songs over again, it mixes the selection nicely unlike Tidal. The only things I would like to see is the year release of the song and album and add the lyrics option like Tidal just did... that would be great. Overall I'll give Spotify a 4.5. Update: 04.12.22- Last Update is making App crash and hang. Pics & Song Information not loadn",positive
"I pay for premium, and it works great. Unlimited skips, I can play any song at any time, and there are MOSTLY no adds. For some reason, I still have two or more adds in my podcasts, which are 30-45 minutes. Not sure if I'm doing something wrong, but it doesn't seem fair that I pay for no adds, and yet there are a surplus of them in every podcast episode.",negative
"Truly enjoying Spotify, I have over 80 hours of hits, only issue is app doesn't play every song on the Playlist, it appears to be on about a 20 song loop. I've seen that many other users have that same issue. Please correct that. Thx!",negative
With the newest update the app doesn't run consistant on my S20 anymore. the currently playing banner is often missing and the playback stops periodically for a couple of seconds.,negative
"This new update is sucks, it keep playing random song from playlist that we choose. I more like the old one and I'm giving 4 star for this.",negative
Wide variety of music. Almost every artist is on here. My only problem is the amount of ads. If you don't have premium you could receive up around 7 ads at a time. Maybe it change I don't know because it got so bad I had to get premium.,negative
When i open spotify its just stuck on the logo screen(means the screen right after opening spotify). Please fix it,negative
The fact that they removed the preview songs before you add them to a playlist feature is incredibly frustrating.,negative
"Used to work perfectly, but This new update keeps stopping randomly when I have it playing without Bluetooth. Also sometimes when you open the app the current song playing doesn't show, so I need to close down the app and reopen it to get it to come back up. Already uninstalled it and reinstalled but it's still not working as well. A shame. Giving a 1 star because I'm paying for premium and this is very annoying.",negative
i love it,positive
"I have 3 Galaxy devices and it's the same over a of them. Stops playing constantly; probably about 10 times in a podcast. Randomly skips songs after the first 30 seconds. Have to reboot ap just to do it all over! Thought it was maybe my phone, but the ap is the same across all devices of mine and same complaints from my sister. I've had buggy aps, but I can say this is the least stable app that I have ever used.",negative
The sound is good. The songs are in a variety from old classics to new contemporary songs,positive
"Just upgraded to premium. Thank you for not bending to the cancel culture mob, and thank you for protecting free speech.",positive
I like it but I have one problem that is the extra songs I hate it when my favorite songs end one of the extra songs starts to play plz delete it,negative
"Absolutely terrible, worst music app ever. I have a friend that likes to share music through Spotify. Every link I click takes me to the correct song, but it doesn't actually play, despite me clicking the play button multiple times. When I do finally get a song to play, I can only shuffle/skip the song about 3 times before it tells me I need premium in order to skip the song again. Really piss poor app, I have to open the song on Spotify and then put it into YouTube to hear ones my friend sends.",negative
"All I know is Spotify, its the only music app I would really use.",negative
"Super glitchy on my S22, doesn't register that it's playing music so I cannot pause, skip, or play back songs.",negative
App is crashing everytime when I am trying to play a music,negative
Awesome feature everything is good,positive
"Using Spotify from 3 years and it worth every single penny, best music app. 100% satisfied.",positive
"Was missing this in our country ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡°, but the ads and the other bugs are so much annoying, this was awesome few years back it was free and there was so much to choose but now, it's a time waist",negative
Very useful and very nice application,positive
"No lyrics on my phone tried almost everything, even after Spotify premium",negative
Good song seltion and good sound and like barily anny ads so its 5 stars for a guy like me,positive
"It's a terrific Music App and the Premium rate is very affordable... Please try to keep it that way. I especially ""Love"" the spin off App ""Stations"".

"I love Spotify for PC, it just works exactly like its supposed to but Mobile just can't catch up, if anything, it gets worse every once and a while. A feature here and there than don't work when it used to, it just doesn't make sense.",negative
So much music! Global reach...make magic for us...we all need it ... everyday!,positive
Easy to use ... great music choices!,positive
"Great for listening to music during a drive, but some songs will get stuck even though my Internet is fine. It used to be smooth without any interruptions and I'm a premium user. Please fix this, and I'll give it a 5 stars",negative
Stop adding songs to the Playlist i create if I wanted to listen to that music i would have played a list that would have me discover songs! I created my own Playlist so I don't have to use my skips looking for a song I want. Very disappointing the app would be great if this was fixed. Don't wast your time getting frustrated.Please fix this,negative
They killed support for the spotify app on my car's reciever without warning. Spotify app functionality was the whole reason I shelled out $500 on that particular reciver. Completely insane that they would do something like that. There should be a class action lawsuit over this nonsense. Would give 0 stars if I could.,negative
So good with every song,positive
Best streaming platform,positive
all my downloads have disappeared.. the app can't play songs again,negative
No longer using this service due to company allowing garbage podcasts with mountains of misinformation.,negative
I download podcasts at home on Wifi and when I get to work to play them it makes me redownload almost all of them via Data. What's up with that? My building blocks out connection so I can't just listen via Data either. Also the app consistantly has problems loading my downloads playlist when I am not connected to internet. Why should this be problem when the podcasts are downloaded?,negative
"Really enjoying the music, made good choice.",positive
"NO INTERNET CONNECTION ISSUE I haven't been able to connect to my Spotify account for the past 1 week because it keeps telling me that there's no internet. Fix this pls else we switch to Audiomack, there are less issues there.",negative
"Great App -30 min 1 ad -Large Variety Of Music -Can make your own playlist -Can listen off app -Some pictures and lyrics during the song -Fun facts about the songs -Many More!!! Edit: To many bugs. Every 5 minutes i'm inable to view lyrics, and preview songs.",negative
I like it but now there is a bug now when I press the repeat button the app crashes that's all I have experienced I will up fate you guys more but still this is a great app!,positive
Its like every other place you can listen to music but I do like that it shows where you are in the song on the lyrics,positive
Get the music of your mood.. Anytime.. Anywhere!!!,positive
I love that I can choose songs to make a playlist (unlike Pandora),positive
Great sound great songs with Bluetooth hookup,positive
"Great app, although it can be glitchy at times. Paying for premiums so worth it.",positive
"I love using Spotify but I keep going back to Amazon Music Unlimited, as I'm on the road a lot and the hands-free feature through Alexa helps keep me safe. Have you ever considered commissioning a hands-free assistant for Spotify, or running it through the Google assistant somehow?",positive
Thanks for increasing subscription fee without informing. ðŸ˜¡,positive
Love it. Listen everyday in my ear buds at work. You freaking rock.,positive
This app is amazing. It has a massive song selection and is simple to use. My colleagues and I love using it,positive
"So disappointed with Spotify. I'm a premium user. I'm having so many issues recently. I'm absolutely fed up! It's getting worse. I cannot get it to stop shutting down , it is happening many times during the course of a podcast/song, I rarely get the bar/arrow at the bottom and most of the time I have little control over the play button. Downloaded/online stuff doesn't even work.Constantly having to close the app and restart. SPOTIFY PLEASE RESPOND WITH A SOLUTION!",negative
Spotify's lack of consciousness and utter disregard for decency is appalling!,negative
I'm unable to view the lyrics of the album's songs of the album so far so good by the chainsmokers,negative
I'm impressed with the amazing variety,positive
Spotify great listen to spotify all the time.,positive
I love to be give 4 coz Spotify is using simple but when advertising Start I hate the app most,negative

This app is awsome you can pretty much listen t what you want,negative
Freezing all the time. Have to force shut.,negative
"UPDATE: Now I constantly get a popup that says i need to allow Bluetooth on android 12 or something. Doesn't matter if I hit allow or maybe later it b keeps popping up. It keeps switching devices. I like spotify, but until they fix this bug where when I'm listening on my phone it switches to an echo dot at home this review stays 1 star.",negative
Best music app no issues or any bugs,positive
"Long time user of free version of spotify, but after the newest update, there's just wayyyy too many ads after 2 or 3 songs. I can't even listen to my music in peace anymore. it would be great if spotify could make an option as a trial for the new update where you could choose to keep using the updated version or return to the previous.",negative
"What happened? It's been working brilliantly for years, but now I can't change the song, the play/stop bar doesn't show it, to stop my music I have to close the app completely, and it's started randomly stopping while songs are playing.. give me the old Spotify back!",negative
This is amazing. I have been to other sites and they cost money for not as much as the free Spotify.,negative

Never any problems..always really good songs very easy to use the app..thanks Spotify for making lists from different artists and bands just from the music I listen to when I open your app new songs are waiting for me from you ðŸ¥°,positive
"Really annoyed Spotify have removed support for Kenwood, JVC & Pioneer car stereos. No longer works. This is clearly due to Car Thing and to force car owners to buy it.",negative
Very good advertisement. songs always disturbe the advertisement. ðŸ˜Œ,negative
Work on your albums. I can't get them in collections instead when you go to albums you see playlist,negative
Great music that you cam play anywhere. Easy to find your favourite songs and set up a play list.,positive

I tried lot of music streaming appsbut this is the best sound quality everloved Spotify premium,positive

It took me a while to get this app to set up right w my alexa system and by a while I mean a year. It seems everything there is an update I have to rework the settings and Google information. This last few weeks it has been working properly. I have multiple alexas that I have synced together to all play the same music.,negative
Love this! My kind of companion and the9 SC band's as well!,positive
"Sensoring, removing and adding trigger/misinformation warnings is GARAGE! Hopefully Joe Rogan leaves...he's the only reason why I use this platform.",negative

Absolution perfect! The music of the world at your fingertips tips!,positive

Premium is the best worth it get a family plan then add all ya mates it's sweet,positive
Everything was great and easy to use until the update came. I cant even repeat the song unless i go to the playlist and click the song again and theres no shuffle anymore which makes a playlist not repetitive anymore,negative
Good app,positive
Everything is osm but from 2 days I can't play songs on it coz everytime I open it and play a song the app gets close on its own... Plzz help!,negative
Very great app the only problem is you should probably have less interruptions when playing music so I'll give this app a four and half,positive
"It was tricky to learn how to play music on Spotify coming from Pandora. The ""add to queue"" function was new to me. Overall I like it a lot for music and podcasts.",positive
"App just goes offline, currently now, my app isn't allowing me play even my downloaded songs, and I logged out, uninstalled and reinstalled again but couldn't log in again. This is a horrible experience I swear.. I'll just have to find another music app. I run a premium family account and my phone's internet is working very well.",negative
I have had Spotify for quite a Weiland overall am happy with my experience. Why are my podcasts playing backwards all of a sudden? Super annoying,negative
Its good,positive
"Got a family account that covers myself, partner and two teenagers for less than a double album a month. Love the song ""radio"" feature which has let discover new music based on my preferences. All in all its a belter of an app and process all my music needs.",positive
I love music so as Spotify.,positive
I support the way Spotify deals with prima donna artists like Neil Young. I'll change my tune if Spotify becomes subjectively censorious or caves to niche special interest activists.,positive
There are too much ads. I know there is premium for ad less experience but still too much ad.,negative
I keep losing the track that is playing. The song does not appear with play/pause etc and I have to restart my phone to get it back. This is a real pain and started two days ago.,negative
Too many ads,negative
"it's very good! I wish there would actually be 30 mins of no interrupted listing, but in reality it's only 10. but def recommend",positive
Can't believe I'm writing this but Spotify has horrible sound quality compared to Anghami. I tried playing the same song here and there and the distortion is clear. Arabic content is very weak. Would rather use Anghami free version and bear the ads than have the free 3 months premium offer from Spotify. Uninstalling right now.,negative
"Its an okay app, But whenever i try to add a song to my playlist the app crashes. Spotify is a good app aside from this problem, Please fix this glitch. Thank you!",positive
"Good selection of genres, sound quality not optimal as its free. However, manage to sign as premium, sound improves.",positive
"** UPDATE ** I am pleased to post an update. The Android version of the Spotify app continues to have a much lower volume when using the equalizer... however, either a Chromebook update or a Spotify app update corrected the sound quality of the music to such a degree that I no longer need to use the equalizer. GOOD JOB!!!",negative
"App crashes, no now playing information. If it ain't broke don't fix it, latest update is garbage",negative
I need you tell you that please increase the sound quality like other apps the sound quality is low in the premium membership also. Apart that everything is perfect.,positive
It's a really good music app u til your free trial is over and nothing works until you buy something,positive
Easy to use with music suggestions that are relevant to my tastes. Easy to add songs to play lists,positive
"Im sorry there are way too many ads, every like 3 songs you'll get 3-4 ads and then your next song will play, However on youtube music you usually get only 1 ad every few songs.",negative
Such a wonderful platform! No single music I like can't be found,positive
Great ðŸ‘ and I look forward to your new drama and the great news ðŸ˜€ ðŸ‘ ðŸ˜„ ðŸ˜Š ðŸ™Œ,positive
Nice with premium,positive
"Finally subscribed to be able to stream joe rogan podcast. Turns theres no video option. ðŸ˜• edit gave the app 3 stars for lacking video support, now deducting one star because of nag screen popup reminding me to leave a review, which I already had.",negative
"I would say it's a great app, but why the hell is changing the music a premium feature shouldn't that be the bare minimum for any music app? It's pretty scummy to make people pay for something that should be a basic feature, and let's not forget the random crashes.",negative
I don't like this I can't unstall it and pls fix this and my fav song is not even here so I am so sorry if I made you sad(Â´âŒ’ï½€;),negative
I literally just downloaded the app but I think it's amazing because it has good music and it plays your music even when your not on the app,positive
"Hey Spotify, when will you fix add to favorites (heart) button so that the heart icon becomes green when the song is added and gets back to the original state once clicked again?",negative
Terrible quality app. Frequently says there is no internet where there absolutely is and it's the only app with that issue. Weird bugs like skipping tracks instead of playing the different song I told it to. No excuse for such a huge platform to not figure out how to make it work consistently.,negative
I really love the app. Very easy to use UI. There's almost no limit to the customization of playlists and your qeue. Overall an amazing experience,positive
great music selection and streaming quallity,positive
"Worst streaming app available especially for podcast. In the middle of podcast it will just skip to the next episode. When I try to go back to what I was listening to it just starts the entire episode over which makes it a pain to find where I was in the episode. Everytime it goes to an advertisement, once the advertisement is over it jumps to the very end of the podcast I was listening to. Again, now I have to try and find where I was in the episode. Very frustrating to use.",negative
"In my opinion Spotify is a great app/software for music but the thing is that I have premiun and there isn't that much you can do in premiun except downloading and no adds and that's kinda all, they should add more things to premiun",negative
"Mini player is not visible sometimes, need to restart Spotify to see the mini player? I think it's a bug and Spotify should play significant attention to this ! This is really hampering user experience.",negative

I don't get it when I try playing a song why does it show different music artists and when I press the play button it appears an other song like I don't know if it's a glitch but please fix this...,negative
"This app is just frustrating. When i create playlist, the app itself adds additional songs;however, i also turned off the autoplay from settings, but it still adds irrelevant songs. Please solve this problem!",negative
Cuts out while playing. Can't control with headphones. Playing song can't be found. Need to close then reopen,negative
Best song collections in one app best music app ever,positive

I like it because I can listen to music,positive
"I used to love spotify so much but since 1 or 2 weeks I can't play my dowloaded songs anymore because it says ""no wifi available"". The whole reason I got spotify premium was to be able to play songs offline and now I can't",negative
too bad cant play songs bad update,negative
Why don't you guys add a minus one feature for every song. Like a karaoke. Since you already have lyrics on some songs.,negative
it is so good because it has all my favorite songs and probaly 1 billion songs,positive
One n only requirement is option to download songs for free,negative
"Songs stop after 2 seconds now on my Pixel 6, after the last update.",negative
"Very nice app. But sometimes it's difficult to search an appropriate song of a particular artist. Most of the time, during search, it appears for most uncommon artists rather than renowned one. I am saying it for Bengali songs.",negative
"Does the job when it works, but half the time it just doesn't connect/load. Fix this. I like that I can stream/connect to my home receiver. I have Premium, so can't comment on ads.",negative
I hate it because everything I play a song it is change and when I want it to play over it never do!!!!,negative
I like the app because it is good for listening to music but there is just kn one issue I have I keeps signing me out of my account randomly and it is quite hard to get back into it when does this. Can you please fix that one issue.,negative
This app is awesome you can listen to anything and it plays the same kind of music you like plus you can make your own playlist...,positive
"Many problems with this app. #1 You canâ€™t even play the songs you want. Every time I shuffle play liked songs or my own playlists it just plays songs that arenâ€™t even there. #2 Too much ads. #3 Whenever I search for a song, I have to go through every single playlist that appeared till I find the one I want, sometimes I donâ€™t even find it. #4 You have 6 skips every hour but canâ€™t even play what you want so I just skip to the song I want but then my skips are just wasted. You need to fix this.",negative
"Great app, easy to use, great app to share your music files with others, collaborate folders. Highly recommend",positive
AMAZING this is a must have if you wanna listen to good quality music :),positive
This is the best music player ever but sometimes I can't download music using cellular data but still it's a five star for me cause I love it ðŸ˜,positive
Overall it's grand but when you go to edit you have to drag song to the top rather than order as recently added etc. Terrible change on Samsung,negative
"Have discovered so much new music since joining Spotify, without a doubt my favourite app.",positive
Cool. Please add spatial audio SpotifyðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™,positive
I love all the music that is on this app but listening to 3 songs and then 4 adds that I can't skip unless I pay it realy annoying. Would love to give a higher rating buy can't with all the adds.,negative
Exellent on music but there the ads,negative
"Excellent app (as long as you have premium), the only part I believe I that spotify needs to add, is the ability to remove unwanted podcasts from your home recommended page.",positive
"Spotif is indeed the best, i play all my music on this app, it's really enjoyable, no ads disturbing the music, it's really quite interesting",positive
"This app is amazing, sure the ads are annoying but it's fine considering I didn't pay for the premium.. just, can you perhaps release romanized lyrics too? For example, I wanna hear and sing to kpop songs but I can't read korean so it would be good if there's a romanized version of the lyrics.. it would help the international fans so much! Anyway, love this app. Thank you for the great experience!",positive
Great experience ðŸ˜ðŸ˜¸ except the add ðŸ˜ƒ pls try to fix it and reduce the amount of ads,negative
Always improving and substantially more evolved than AM. Bring on Spotify HiFi.,positive
Fu***** annoying ads. I realise the need to put ads but it would be nice if you would not play back to back ads. Spoils the mood. Your advertisement department really needs to be layed off for such a retarded decision making.,negative
"It became a part of my daily live. I love all the functions and everything it has to offer, the platform is really easy to use too. Worth to upgrade to premium.",positive
"Play menu suddenly stopped showing up, so now I can't control the song I picked, like pausing or skipping it. And when I lock my phone, it just stops playing.",negative
Only if there was an option to get rid of shuffle play on phoneðŸ“± without getting premium.,negative
This App is Trash I listen to Music every day and it says Something went wrong and it keeps saying that this App is Trash don't use this app also it doesn't have any songs from Soundcloud also if I have Two accounts they both don't work,negative

Its is a nice app but we need to pay money to listen we are poor what we can do,negative
"love spotify, but I have problems with the app crashing like others. also, the ads are horrible. if you watch an ad to get 30 minutes with none you usually get one after like 2 songs.",negative
"Breaking up often (typically every each 9-10 seconds) skipping 2-3 seconds. Extremely annoying. Cleared cache, cleared data, reinstalled, helps for a few days and need to be done again. Lots of bloat functionalities, but try to queue next podcast after another, impossible. Home menu living its own odd life, favourites as well. Looking at blog nobody is doing anything for ever green bugs, sad.",negative
"Couldn't delete from all devices fast enough, worthless service.",negative
Add equilizer like MX player. Sound Equilizer is in setting it might be in music dashboard to use it easily.,positive
"I love Spotify as a whole - it has everything i look for in a music app. But constant issues with the functionality are very annoying. It stops playing and crashes all the time, the progress bar randomly stops displaying the accurate place in songs and podcasts, and sometimes doesn't connect to my Bluetooth speaker. I don't have any of those problems on the desktop app. Edit: 6/25/2022 and still having the same issues. No attempts to fix them whatsoever.",negative
My Spotify lyrics is not open,negative
It's a little weird because wen you look up a song and press on one that's the sone you want it is not the song you want but over all it's pretty good,positive
"Ads are very irritating rest this app is very handy, and the podcasts can be downloaded too. One can also connect one account on various devices so that one's favorite playlist can be heard anywhere",negative
Love this! Has all the music I love!,positive
Best music provider.,positive
Great sound and awesome collection of music.,positive
"Love Spotify! I love French Cafe music and this app offers a lot of song titles!! Spotify is my favorite musical app by far:) I'm 55y young, and love their selection of early 20th Century American music as well, especially the tunes with the scratchy record sound!:)",positive
Umm... Lately There is Auto Pausing Problem when the screen Locks Hope It Will Fix Soon,negative
"Though song collection is very good but my complaint is that i paid Rs 389/- as 3month subscription to Spotify premium yet my account still displays Spotify free...When you have downloaded songs as premium account holder , you are not able to play them offline...then why should one go for Spotify premium ?",negative
Amazing... I love the audio quality and the songs mostly all songs I found here.... But there is so much adds too but it's ok it's a good experience ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€,positive
Thanks for fixing the bugs bestie,positive
"I'm not sure what is going on with reliability lately - if it's the app or Android OS but Spotify freezes, pauses constantly. Very frustrating, especially after cache clearing and restarting my phone. This should be sorted before too long. I know a good number of other people having these issues aswell. Ill have to cancel my subscription if these issues persist. Brand new phone so it can't be the hardware. * Seems like now Spotify won't share links either?",negative
Keeps pausing on playback.,negative
Really i love very much Spotify i feel the song everytime through Spotify searching option is amazing thank you so much Spotify to provide mind free songs from all languages,positive
"I have been using this app for a few years, but now the ads have become so irritative. Now ads are appearing in between the songs and that is too annoying. Spotify Lite is better when compared to Spotify.",negative
Loving this app. Can't live without it. It's my auto music player in the morning when I drive to work.,positive
"Easy to be hacked, while playing my fav track another song is being played and even after complaining multiple timr still the issue is going on ðŸ˜¡",negative
Very reliable. Good sound quality and good music variety.,positive
"I enjoy using the app and have all of my music, podcasts and some audiobooks all in one place. I wish there was a better way to organize files a little more specific then what is available now but I make it work. Quality has always been good! The one or two times it messed up after an update I cleared cache, forced stop and the reopened the app. Simple enough!",positive
I see the meaning of lif3 every time I listen to music on Spotify,negative
"Please get back the short listening button at the suggested page that show ups when we tap to the ""add songs"" thing. I'm too lazy to listen to whole music to see if I like it or not. Short versions are better but overall it's a great app",positive
Thank you Spotify for not caving to the cancel culture mob. In a time when the left loves to cancel anything they disagree with its good to know at least one platform has the cajones to not bow down to the mob.,positive
Good,positive
"Is anyone else having this issue? When i open a playlist i dont get options from where to start, when i get those they start playing from the highlights. Only 6 skips are allowed per hour? This isnt spotify lite! I didnt happen befor and its not hapening in my tab, what's the issue? I hope someone can help.. i dont even know what im doing wrong. I have a doubt abt this being lite but i dont think so pls help thank you",negative
Great service but the last update caused weird bugs on my device!,negative
"Ever since the latest update it's been slow. Not only that, but it's always shutting down while I have other apps on, like a game for instance. It never used to do that before.",negative
"I love the app, I use it everyday. And I love the lyrics update, tho I heard that some other people don't have it and they really want it, so thats sad.",positive
"Recent versions of the app are extremely buggy to the point that I might have to switch to something else. The most annoying bug is after a couple minutes the menu that lets you play and pause music disappears. So there is no way to control the music playback until you force close the app and reopen. Also, often it doesn't save changes to playlists or to my liked songs list anymore. This is basic functionality that no longer works. ðŸ˜­",negative
It's good although the ads are sometimes annoying but overall it's a good experience,positive
"Right now it keeps crashing and the play and pause buttons keeps disappearing, super annoying",negative
Nostalgic,positive
Best app i have ever seen and discovered ðŸ’œ Every type of songs are available in this appðŸŒ· No ads and no more bugs/glitchesðŸ¥€ my experience was great with this app but i can't download the songs.... I wanna download my favorite songs in my folders but it is not downloading it and i don't even know how to download songs!

Have premium.... Love it!! Sooo much music,positive
App constantly pauses/closes and the navigation bar dissapears on two different phones I have. It's extremely frustrating,negative
FILTER ISSUE No longer plays the set filter on your liked songs list and even when you restart the app or clear the filter and reset the filter and make sure that the song is selected while the filter is set it does not play the Filtered songs that show in the regular playlist,negative
Seems a little slow but great selection.,positive
I love everything about this music app. I have fallen in love and will neva enjoy another music app like I do Spotfi.,positive
Good song play!,positive

Exciting,positive
"won't play music due to an issue common through all users in my region. tried to report it using their website, the website didn't work.",negative
"Cannot cancel premium user via the app, which is a big hassle. Should add the option to opt out of the subscription via app. You just milking out people.",negative
I already pay for premium. DISABLE. THE F**KING. POPUPS. We've been telling you for AGES. Deezer and YouTube Music never felt so enticing.,positive
super nice Spotify and i learn to sing,positive
"Songs won't play, stop playing on there own, playlists won't sync with anything on my computer that's singed into the same account. Have to fully close and restart the app. Half the time it won't even show what song I'm playing at the bottom of the screen. Playlists undownloading then redownloading by themselves. Usually always right before I go out. Overall 1 out of 5 stars. I would use anything over this horrible platform but there is no better options",negative
"Used the ""workout"" mode in Rock and couldn't have been more pleased! Great app!",positive
There is a good quality of music which I listen and enjoy 24/7.,positive
BRING BACK THE PREVIEW BUTTON WHEN ADDING SONGS. the dumbest update you've ever made was removing it.,negative
I like being able to listen to music for free and I can have a family account. It's definitely makes things easier.,positive
Very relaxing ang enjoyed the music,positive
Been using spotify for years. Great amount of metal music on there. :-),positive

Great music experience.,positive
Playbar keeps disappearing. Have to restart phone often to fix it,negative
I love it 3 idk what else to say srry,positive
"Frustrating app. Seems to get worse on a semi-monthy basis. I've been using it for about 4 years + now. Great selection has kept me there but the app constantly having problems and ruining podcasts listening will likely move me towards another platform. Still, the best selection. But what's the point when the app can't play them. You'd think with all the money brought in and it being they're only real business that they would have a more seamless operation for actually listening.",negative
"If you plan on paying to avoid ads and listen to podcasts or anything other than music, DO NOT BUY SPOTIFY. with the rising of people adding in content ads and such makes premium obsolete. They constantly try popping open some info on car mode while I'm driving which is a hazard. This app Is really really going down the drain. Just use apple music or Dropout TV. Or anything else really.",negative
The app used to be good for music (it has never been the best option for podcasts) but it is so buggy now that it is almost unusable.,negative
I love it it never fail great Playlist it worth every penny,positive
It is bad one day we added just was on my play list and I couldn't turn it off plus the we added songs was nothing like what I like to listen to but before that happened it was a 4 star,negative
Please add more items on profile & setting.,positive
Memories wonderful,positive
Easy to use and still free,positive
App is a bit buggy after last update. Stops randomly and sometimes I can't see what's currently playing at the bottom of the screen. Also doesn't always sync well with desktop app,negative
"Syncing Galaxy Watch 4 with Spotify Playlist.....not consistent whatsoever. App on watch does not recognize that songs have already been downloaded, app crashes and when controlled by phone is slow to react. The app needs drastic improvement for functionality.",negative

Best music library ever! I love it!,positive
"Even after having Premium Plan, I'm unable to share the lyrics of any songs.",negative
This app was good but now it only plays 10 minutes of a podcast and then stops. You have to hit play again for it to continue to play.,negative
"I've been using Spotify for about 4 years now as a paid subscriber. It has an awesome variety of music and I never have any issues when using it offline. Since the last update though, my music cuts out in the middle of a song and the play bar keeps disappearing. I reinstalled the app yesterday and it worked fine for a while but its doing the same thing again today. I hope this gets fixed soon or I will have to consider looking for another music source.",negative
Love itmy go to,positive
It has so many ads i am really going for other choices then spotify i really loved if they had less ads. Ads are okay but they have ads like 1 song 2 ad ðŸ™„ its frustrating it's like you are listening song for ads.,negative
Spotify keep giving me HORROR ADS At least give me pleasant ads,positive
Excellent app. Tried all the others this is the best hands down.,positive
Love being able to create my own Playlists and the suggestions given are always on point!,positive
"I love spotify, my favorite app. Just wish could download song onto device from app.",positive
I love Spotify. It's the best app to listening to some music and podcast. The radio mode is top notch. Recommend it for everyone. 10/10!,positive
Definitely a five star app. It has every song in the book. Plus lyrics. And it's fast.,positive
"Great choice of music, easy to find, user friendly interface. Loving it so far.",positive
Enjoyable .... It's only when you listen to radio stations daily that you realise how repetitive they are.,negative
It is has amazing options. But it always have problems with loading. It always shows (no internet connection available). While all other apps work absolutely fine in my current network connection.,negative
"UPDATE: Issue has been resolved. Spotify is awesome. I love that I can make my own Playlist. Great feature! I enjoy using Spotify. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that I can't turn off shuffle play. I have tried everything. Also, I was told that Spotify no longer takes my MC debit card issued through my credit union for payment. I have to go to the store and purchase a gift card for payment. However, my daughter uses the same credit union and she hasn't had any trouble.",positive
"I can longer have my Spotify play on my phone if I have it open on my computer, I have to close the app on my computer or else it will just kick me off the app on my phone",negative
"the best it is not bad, I love it because it lets you make your own playlist and it lets you put what whatever songs you want on a certant playlist",positive
Well realy love Spotify but very time Im playing a game while using Spotify music randomly stops so still a good music app,positive
"Spotify itself is great. I can pick my own songs, rewind/skip, and do all the basic things of a music streaming service. The app ruins it all. First of all, if you choose a song you want, it ""shuffles"" it. What that means is it plays different songs than the one you specifically chose. You have to use up all your skips to get the actual song (which it doesn't let you add to playlists). Second, no FF/RWing. Overall, it's a terrible experience and I am moving to Tidal.",negative
"Serious privacy issues. Exercise care whatever you do, and assume everything you do is visible to everyone. Playlists are created as public by default, the app doesn't mention it with a single word. You have to download the desktop version to change this default, buried in privacy settings. Dear Spotify team, I wanted a music player, not another way to exercise online exhibitionism.",negative
Update Extremely Bugged. Please revert to old update. Search bar isn't formatted and is cut off. Can play music but doesn't actually visually show any song was selected.,negative
"I usually play the ""Daily Drive"" playlist, which contains music numbers and news plus other podcasts. I hate football and it still plays ""FC Afkicken"" podast. Why isn't there a button to dislike/block stupid podcasts like unliked sports!?",negative
this is very nice aap,positive
Its very good vibe   ,positive
"Awesome, but 3 stars for a few reasons; 1. App crashes consistently on my phone. 2. I have to wait a hour just to get 6 skips. 3. Umm.. No third reason but three stars is my rating",negative
I really really appreciate it. It's the best app for listening music with best subtitleðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ’¯ðŸ”¥,positive
"It's not great to use on phone, I've got to say. I can't disable shuffle and on a free plan I get up to 6 skips per hour (?) which is real fun when 5 out of 10 songs playing from my created playlist are suggested by spotify, aka NOT CHOSEN BY ME. Even marking songs to be hidden from playlists, they just get suggested again. I sometimes spend half the time listening to stuff I don't want to hear... on mobile data no less...",positive
It is the best music app,positive
The app is shutting down randomly.,negative
"Spotify js good to listen to music, but the adds are to much and plus if your going to add ads at least make it so that we can skip them. Also when you add Playlist spotify plays random songs you didn't even add to your play list ik spotify adds some but when you remove it jt still does its just really annoying",negative
Best - Thank you for making the difficult decision to continue supporting Joe Rogan despite the controversies that have been created around his content and past use of language. I wish more tech organizations could be able to make such decisions based on the totality of the situations and nuance of the topic,negative

Why i cn Not open my acc in spotify i cnnot log in plss fix this,negative
I have been using premium for years but within the last week my downloads have been disappearing for no reason after being played once. At this point im ready to just buy the albums i listen to on other platforms since this specific bug has come and gone over the years and should not be present after 6 years of development.,negative
Ok let's get straight to it because I'm about to get upset Spotify is the best app I've used in a million years! Ha thought it was a complaint didn't you...gotcha?,positive
"I like to hear what I like to hear, I need to be able to skip. For free like YouTube",positive
No commercials I can do whatever I want have my music on I love this app,positive
Since I started using Spotify I'm enjoying it. I had another similar music app and was doubtful about using Spotify and wasn't even really sure what this app entailed but I found out and downloaded it and enjoying thus far very much. It's great ðŸ‘ðŸ¼,positive
It's a very nice app with all kinds of songs,positive
Good to anything i want and need,positive
Never thought I'd enjoy music streaming services until now. YouTube and Spotify are my apps of choice for audio whatwith the downfall Google Play Music.,negative
I wish I had premium but otherwise great experience,positive
It's really good the ads are alittle unbareable sometimes but I'm having issues usally you can loop songs and anonymous shuffle playlist on spotify for samsung smart tv but when I click loop on my samsung tv it's not letting me loop at all but the buttons are still there can I get any help to solve this?,negative

"I've been using and paying for Spotify premium since I was in 7th grade. I am now a college sophomore and thinking of cancelling my well-loved subscription because of the constant skipping of songs. I don't know why or when exactly the problem started, but almost every song skips like a bad record and I haven't found a single effective solution. reinstalling, reporting the bug, opening and closing ect ect. I love this app and I would hate to lose it, but this issue is incredibly frustrating.",negative
Music quality is fine ; decent but for the non premium member its going disappointing day by day .. in my first experience ads appears then after 6 songs now this is after the every 2 songs ... this is not done ... thinking for Uninstall this app ....untill the margin increases to 6 songs ðŸ˜” ðŸ˜Ÿ ðŸ™,negative
Soo great app but one problem it's the fact that when we add new songs to playlist there is a recommend section when we wanna know how the song sounds like you can just hear to a little part of the song i don't know if is just for me.but it ain't working it was a great feature please.just please bring it back,positive
"I pay for premium don't give me pop-up ads. The new car mode doesn't let you control the music from the car at all, which is incredibly unsafe and asinine. The new lyrics feature is garbage and makes the player lag. I am this close to just trashing Spotify and swapping to another music service. Update: Not even the basic functionality of prev/next song works consistently any more. That's it. I'm done.",negative
I love that music is made available for me The playlist diversity The podcasts are both educational and entertaining And last but not the least the payment plans as well as student discounts which is very helpful and love it that even i can easily afford the monthly fee Keep it up Spotify Co.,positive
"This app never fails to be unable to play downloaded podcasts / music when I'm on a trip. I downloaded the podcasts, I can see that they are downloaded but in offline mode it still won't let me play them. I'm so over this unreliable app. I'll be moving to Google podcasts when I need stuff downloaded. Hey Spotify, here is a tip. If you are going to pay Joe Rogan $100 million dollars, maybe you should invest in actually making you podcasting feature work as advertised",negative
I know without premium there are many ads but the fact that this is an amazing app for listening songs,positive
You cant go against islam,positive
I wish that you could choose whether or not you want spotify to add to your playlists... I personally hate it... I made the playlist with certain songs in it... I don't need more songs added... maybe you could recommend those songs to be added but you just adding them makes my playlists useless and there was no point in me making it if you were just going to change it,negative

I don't like how on mobile it plays the wrong music when I click on the music I want to listen to and how I can't listen to my liked music but otherwise it's a very good app to use!! :)),positive
Just constantly recommending podcasts to me despite not using it for podcasts. Can't stop it and it's now useless for discovering music and much more frustrating just to get to music.,negative
Please fix your app my podcasts stop about every 5 minutes and I need to close the app and refresh it. It gets very annoying at work while doing things,negative
Im want my like song like long drives but when i touch it i got loafers why i miss the old spotify,negative
thsi app is good but to make it more populer u can do an updated for no paying monthly or yearly for free and can get premium,negative
It's a quick app contains every artist you can search for.,positive
Best app for kpop especially bts,positive
SUCH A GOOD APP FOR MUSIC! LOVEEEEEE IT SO SO MUCH! THE BEST APP MUSIC FOR ME!!! THEY UPDATE A NEW MUSIC RIGHT ON TIME AND EVERYDAY GOT NEW THINGS TO BE EXPLORE!,positive
I use Spotify almost daily for like 6 years Good app It has tons of music and if it doesnt have something you can add local files to your playlist 2024 edit the update is incredible So much easier to organize playlists now and adding free audiobooks is such a bonus,positive
"By far the best music playing I've ever downloaded, has amazing songs and Spotify Premium is literally the best. I highly recommend this to all of your friends and family!!",positive
"Free version is a bad as local radio. It says 30 minutes of commercial free, as long as you don't skip a song or artist",negative
"User unfriendly and poor sound quality. I can't scroll back in a song. I can't skip to the previous song if I want to hear it again. For example, I added Dream Theater. I just want to listen to Images and Words from the beginning to the end of the album. Sometimes I want the album in a loop. Don't go mixing stuff randomly. If I want something else, I'll click another album. YouTube has better sound quality and allows me to skip. Just wanted a playlist for long drives.",negative
It's a really good app but song lyrics are wrong ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜Ÿ,negative
"its okay no bad condition , and so good to use that's why i rate this spotify 5stars ðŸ’–",positive
when i want to buy spotify premium mini always unable to connect.,negative
There is some changes in my Spotify thr music won't play I even made a new acc but still it did not work,negative
Best music app out there. Premium is worth the purchase.,positive
"Suddenly Spotify won't support Kenwood, JVC or Alpine car radios. I was informed the company has no intention of fixing this problem. I bought a $1000 radio with Spotify built-in then Spotify discontinued functional support for it. I am really quiet pisses me off. Spotify you need to fix this! I have paid your $10 a month for years. This is the thanks that you gave me. Subscription! $10 a month and can't get customer service or good service ðŸ™„!",negative
the new update sucks. it logs you out from time to time and it's just so glitchy.,negative
"Recently got premium, thinking it would allow the songs to be downloaded on my actual device, as in the settings it asked me where the songs would be stored(phone or storage). But to my disappointment it gets downloaded only on the app. Also on the free version there's too many ads only on how annoying their ads are, please stop it there's memes on that topic now lol. But overall the experience with premium ain't too bad ngl.",negative
Easy to use and great range of music and podcasts.,positive
Awesome app! Been using it daily since 2010!,positive
"Good app, only thing is I only want the 10USD plan and it wants me to pay 20 now for 2 accounts with no option to change back to the original",negative
3 minute ads you can't skip...,positive
Deleting this app. Thumbs down for introducing ads.,negative
Excellent suggestion..... what a songs...Fall in love of it... very good as compared to wink and other apps...,positive
"If you want to discover new music than this app is for you. Because it will add to your Playlists, it does not give a choice in the matter. I understand what they were meaning when they did this but it can get annoying. If they fixed this I would like it more.",negative
Amazing app,positive
"Cant even play the song i wanna play... In a Music Streaming app, I cant play a song i want",negative
"Spotify is a great way to listen to music although the recommendations are aren't always great. I often listen to music that I don't want influencing the recommendations since they don't always capture the feeling or specific sounds that I like. I wish there was a way to prevent those songs from being used in recommendations even without having to use private mode. It would also be nice if there was more control over the songs added to the Blend playlist besides listening and hoping songs get added to replace other songs I don't want in there. Spotify connect is and the in app notifications from connect is annoying since I always accidentally press connect to TV or google mini. More ways to edit and filter playlists would be nice like the ability to filter playlists based on loved tracks, time (like on desktop) and statistics like most/least played track and artist. Also, being able to mark each song by the mood/feeling that associate it with would be great for new song recommendations and filtering.",positive
"I gave this many stars a while back but for the last few months it's been crashing left and right. Everytime I start getting into the music BAM, it crashes. So sick of this $#!+ going back to the other one. Back to one star since I can't give it ZERO.",negative
"Love it, Dope user interface, I get all music I'm looking for",positive
Automatically playing stop,negative
This has been a great deal with the best variety of affordable music to suit anyone's tastel,positive
"Downloaded it agian to hear a local bands music, click play on there stuff, it plays so other bands music. Overrated app they need to sell it to Elon Musk.",negative
I can't listen to my music and I have to pay with is unfair and recommend do not download. I always have to listen to other music they recommend but they all suck. It's better to just hear music on youtube,negative
Delivers all our music and podcast requirements,positive
I love it but when I want to play one music it plays something else,positive
This app is nice ,positive

Best music platform out there. I enjoy it.,positive
"I'm trying to do a nap playlist but it keeps adding songs I don't want. I just want two specific songs, I don't want it adding a bunch of other things. It also added stuff to my other playlist which was four specific songs. I don't want the app adding songs it thinks are relevant, if I want a song, I'll add it. If they want to suggest songs, they may, but I don't want all of these other songs coming up. Edit: I deleted it. In addition, I can't listen to more than previews of the songs I like.",negative
"Become a member and listen to your tunes uninterrupted , I'm not a robot. Just use the app daily it's great in my opinion.",positive
I love spotify it's the best music app ever I use it every day,positive
I love it i can find diffrent kinds of songs without a problem,positive
Finally got Spotify Premium and it's worth it. No more annoying ads and so many features. The price is reasonable to be fair. I just love it.,positive
"Fix the glitch where if you like a song without actually clicking it to make it play, it doesn't actually add to your liked songs. The heart will fill green and appear so but if you go into album and play song, it's not filled green or 'liked'",negative
"Just love this......thanks to this app,it has introduced me to great world of music. It's been 3 yrs since I have downloaded it ,had great experience , this app is totally flawless.",positive
"It is a good app that i use multiple times a day but after every song i get an ad, i am never allowed to skip any songs and despite what i changed in settings every second song is completely random.",negative
"Sometimes lags when out and about. And it's great way to accessing music, and creating Playlist like back in the day.",positive
"Great app. They play latest and old music to suit every client. The app plays smooth and doesn't have connection interruptions. I actually appreciate the adds on the app because the service it provides saves me a lot of money, time, and research. I just love Spotify. Great work guys",positive
"It used to be amazing but now nothing ever loads whenever I click on my likes, artist, Playlist, etc. I thought it was my phone but its still happening.",negative
Very good and good quality music,positive
Most recent update has broken the app on the S9. 50% of the time you lose the ability to see whats currently playing and skip songs.,negative
I don't like it so many ads after every one song.... This not suitable for who not purchase premium...,negative
"In my opinion, Spotify is a great app to listen to. Though it may not have a few songs, I like it.",positive
"Lol, it's an amazing app. It's so great that I can pay just for one time for one month, and renew it again when I want to when I have money to.. it really is a good thing for students who aren't earning, who depend on their parents' money...",positive
"i love using spotify, but currently on my samsung galaxy s9 i havent been able to pause my music from the lock screen, or play it if it was previously paused. im not sure what to do about that, is there something you can do to fix it? ive tried reinstalling the app, restarting my phone, fore stopping the app, etc. and nothing is working.",negative
"Hello. I've been always using this app and before this, the widget that I put at the home screen always looks like the colour of the song album that I am listening too but I don't know if you are not allowing to use that update anymore or what but I love that update so can you please bring them back?",positive
"This is an amazing app and to have everything at your fingertips integrated to Shazam makes it the best app for music. My only problem is any downloaded content does not show up when I do not have any access to data which it should provide access to any downloaded content if on a premium subscription. Please can you fix this asap as it's been an annoyance to a point where I feel like deleting all downloaded content, cancelling my subscription and deleting the app.",negative
"I can't access the premium account using mobile device,........",negative
This app is beast songs hearing music app,positive
"Constantly deletes library every update, features don't work, like wrapped, uploading your own songs is an awful process and doesn't appear in library, slow app.",negative
"Wrost of all the music apps there are. The free version is wrost of this of all, there is an ad literally after every song of about 1 minute.",negative
Find any music that you could ever want to listen too,positive
It doesn't let me to listen to the songs I want recently! And it says I can't skip the unwanted tracksðŸ˜‘,positive
Wide range of songs Less advertisements inbetween songs wld b great,positive

It just stops working in between on mobile data. Everything else works on it but Spotify keeps showing it's offline and there's no internet connection. Tried everything and it still won't recognise my cellular data.,negative
"I like this app very much. But unfortunately, I pressed the button that puts the song in the TV. And I didn't want that to happen. But now it's all good. So, thanks for making this app awesome!",positive
Spotify is great for listening to all sorts of music! My only problem is that it cost 10 dollars a month for premium.,positive
Love my Spotify Premium!,positive
Nice experience ,positive
"Excellent app. Better than pandora by a million times. Absolutely paying for it, it's worth it.",positive
Great choice of music with wide range of genres.,positive
"The worst, most unstable app I've ever used for Android. Audio goes out when screen turns off, audio controls frequently crash while playing, integrated ads crash podcasts, audio skips, etc. I want to support Spotify because of commitment to free speech, but such an awful, unstable POS makes it a challenge.",negative
STOP REMOVING MY FAVORIT SONGGGGS PLEEEEEASAAAASE but other then that its good,positive
Exceptional application and exquisite terms of use.,positive
"Great app, but it has a lack of informations about the artists and songs.",negative
"Easy to find good music, old music I used to enjoy, new music I'm finding to love!ðŸ¤©",positive
"Best collection of music, features & plans that you can share with your friend or family. Interface is very easy to use. Great for parties as you can customise your own playlists to themes you like. 10/10 for me",positive
This is good but it can't play in no internet,negative
"Spotify is wonderful and there is almost no problem with it, but I would constantly have suggested songs pop up while I am listening to my liked playlist. I find it extremely irritating if I have to use all my skips to skip songs that are not on my playlist and songs in a language I can not understand. I have disabled the autoplay function but it seems that is not enough. I would only recommend Spotify if you plan to use Spotify premium.",negative
Brilliant and easy,positive
"Like this app, never had it crash and content is awesome",positive
Easy to install. Ready to listen to some good music,positive
Its awesome,positive
"I have used almost every music provider except apple's music. So, I can say that the differences in audio quality are barely noticeable but the usability differs. For example, here in Spotify, you can stream music from one place to different devices, can add sleep timers, recommendations are better than the competition and, the number of content is huge, added to that there is a windows app that works seamlessly. App experiences are good, if it gets any bugs; it gets fixed in the next update.",positive
I love Spotify it's like the best thing to listen to music on,positive
WAS a good app. Until you couldn't play the song without shuffling. And the layout is different. I advise you to go back to YouTube music. At least could play a song. :(,positive
Best music app without lags nice sound quality and with a good price and easy to use.,positive
"Love this app, but occasionally has a problem where the music just stops. I can tell it's malfunctioning today because the song playing is not updating in the preview bar. Galaxy S21",negative
"Spotify does A/B testing all the time. It's unfortunate I fell under it and now have to see the ugliest UI in the history where play button is on left and previous/next button is in middle of nowhere. I really hope the UI designer stops talking the ""stuff"" and do not screw the working UI",negative
Nice,positive
Updating my review. I still absolutely love this app and service. They recently just brought back their widget. My review would be five stars if they would bring back the scanning function for group sessions. It works better than sending links.,positive
"I love the app but I'm experiencing a lot of problems lately 1. The app keeps glitching and becoming faulty .I have tried uninstaling and redownloading the app many times but it still doesn't work 2. I can use the app but music can stop playing on its on . Also the controls for the app go Grey so when I want to stop music ,I have to close the application and sometimes that doesn't work Please help I really don't want to be using apple music ðŸ˜¢",negative
"very good, but sometimes bugs out when switching between default and car mode",negative

It's very nice loved this app but the ads are long but it not a big problem loved it,positive
"Please, how do I turn the shuffle off? Is annoying. I don't need the shuffle thing",negative
Good but some songs missing in list,negative
"Favorite app to listen to music on but I hate the new update, when I am adding songs to my playlist to see if I would like them, I'd prefer to listen to them first on Spotify rather than searching them up on YouTube. If you could make it to where you can listen to a short section of the song again, that would be much appreciated!",negative
Just uninstalled the app for sending promotional notifications at 1 am.,negative
Super relaxing music ,positive
Descent app no complaints. Mostly use for podcasts.,negative
I got 5gb downloaded music data on my phone storage and tried to move it to my sd card in the spotify app settings but it didn't finished and now I can't open the app it says it is not responding! I'm paying for this app now what do I do?!!!,negative
"Excellent music, exceptional audio quality. I love it",positive
Spotify keeps crashing and I can't see the song I'm playing on my notification bar.,negative
"Amazing Sound Quality , Ads is an issue For a free listenerðŸ˜Œ",positive
Wanna see video version on mobile data?... Good luck! What a piece of intelligence-insulting garbage! User-hostile.,negative
"I like this app very much , but MY ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT : I THINK IT'S VERY STUPID THAT YOU HAVE TO SKIP TO YOUR FAVORITE SONG AND ALSO THAT YOUR SONG THAT YOU SEARCH IS SHUFFLED WITH OTHER SONGS!!!!!!",negative
it'd be more better if we can choose the music without premium account :D,negative
I pay for spotify and the most annoying issue that I have been having is that while listening to a podcast when not connected to my car or headphones the audio just stops playing until I turn my phone back on. It's completely annoying especially when your trying to do dishes and have to continuously turn your phone on in order to just keep listening to a podcast.,negative
Spotify have everything that you could possibly want to listen to.,positive
"The app is good but, I think it's too restricting. For example, I played my fav song in my playlist but somehow, it played the other different song in my other playlist. Second thing is that, my cousin purchased the premium and it doesn't even show the download button or neither a pending bar for the download. It also doesn't show if the music is downloaded or not. It's a shame that the app has great performance but it's too restricting.",negative
Spotify is spot on for music lovers. The collection is thoughtful and the interface is friendly. An app that makes your feet tap.,positive
Spotify is good but when I first got it didn't have ads or nothing like that and now I need premium for that,negative
Stuck at logo and loading screen after I log out.,negative
I can't login in this app.Please fix it soon.,negative
This is a great music app!,positive
Did the menu change for anyone else because my play and stop button are on the left now and the skip buttons (both directions) are next to it on the right so it's not symmetrical and it's honestly giving me anxiety and i want it back the way it was before :( other than that and the fact some songs aren't on there it's a great app,negative
Easy to use. Great selection.,positive
Guys stop use this app and more listen adverts then music and... Use your sd or mp3,negative
"Hardly works. Click on liked songs, doesn't load. Have to close the app and try again and repeat until it works. Still my preferred music app but it's a struggle. Try to click play nothing happens, lots of bugs.",negative
Love it daily premium listener and can't be happier. Cheap affordable quality music literally at my fingertips 6/5ðŸŒŸ,positive
been a member since 2012. still my fav music app!! thank you for high quality music!!,positive
Free version is barely functional. Spotify needs to provide more of my $$ to artists before I go back to a paid acct.,negative
I love it its great I dont have any complaints,positive
My favorite app. No need to look for CDs anymore. All music at my fingertips.,positive
"My wife and I will be leaving Spotify (both accounts). Spotify is a great streaming service, however we do not solicit any product that bows the ""woke crowd""....ie the Rogan episode.",positive
Best music every time,positive
It was going well than it wouldn't let me play the song I wanted it was picking the music for me and it wouldn't let me skip back to the others music.,positive
"An unprecedented experience,smooth animationsðŸ’¯",positive
"Working well now The only improvement suggestion would be an option for a bigger widget than 1x4, then you could fit in buttons to turn random on/off, and maybe a drop down list of saved playlists etc. The widget just seems small and basic at the moment compared to widgets for mp3 players.",negative
Too goodU can still hear the music when u go to different apps,positive
Good music and easy to use,positive
Very good app with a wide genre of music!,positive
Really good best app ,positive
"This app is really amaizing. I love this app, we canfound all song here. I give it 5star, because it's really trusted app Spotify",positive
"The App keeps saying I'm offline every single time. I've tried ah available methods but still. To be honest, it's very irritating. You guys should a way to fix this considering the fact I've seen a lot of people complain about this problem.",negative

"PODCASTS DO NOT PLAY. I PAY FOR PREMIUM, MUSIC WORKS BUT NOT PODCASTS.",negative

Idk why the app gets uninstalled on itself when I don't open it for a day,negative
Bad aap,positive
For whatever reason I can't scroll to see the different genres/moods for my liked songs.,negative
I've found a lot of great music that wouldn't be recommended at any other platform. I love ittt,positive
"I have autoplay turned off on all devices, but music added by Spotify continues to play after my queue is done. I clear them out manually, then a whole lot more is generated. Please fix this or let me know what else I can do to make it stop. Thank you.",negative
April 16 2022. App is garbage. So many issues lately. No button to skip or pause. Have to end the program to stop music. For a multi billion dollar company you would think you could get the app right,negative
Love the free music and library,positive
Best music app experience!! Would 100% recommend to anyone,positive
Edit: I am really love spotify its really nice looking and always have my taste in music and with enhance the new feature it's been really more enjoyable and really good high energy music so far the for spotify team,positive
"The most counter intuitive music player ux I have ever used. I can't figure out how to replay a song, how to go back to a song I just listened to. Its like the player just decides what you should listen to and plays it. It's annoying as hell. Takes me out of the zone.",negative
"I don't know what's happening but every song I play lags, the songs sound like a scratched CD but the podcasts play without any pauses or problems, I deleted and re-downloaded hoping that it would be fixed but it's still an issue. I tried updating but nothing helped.",negative
Wouldn't recommend any other music app. Brilliant!,negative
"By far the best music listening app. However, for some reason, when skipping a song forth or back, my phone's fps drops to 3. I don't know how skipping a song makes it this laggy. But other than this minor user experience issue, great app!",positive
Not able to open....doing log in but its not opening its been two three days. Please do something so irritatingðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜’,negative
Switched from Deezer after 7+ years and very disappointed. Deezer app was crashing a lot year ago. Now was pretty stable. However Spotify app stop every 3rd or so song during playing and require to hit play button again. Running Android 12 on Google Pixel 4a.,negative
An enormous variety of music to suit everyone,positive
Still the best streaming music app on Android,positive
Spotify software is almost as annoying as Apple software. The constant badgering to link to Bluetooth devices when opening the app can end at any time. It really sucks that when you search an artist it will not allow you to see all their top songs. Most of the time you don't know what album it's from and you just want to see the top 15 or 20 songs. You can't on Spotify. It also continuously auto plays everytime you get in your vehicle rather than staying paused. Blasts when you get in.,negative
The best app so far for music lovers. Virtually all genres of music with a lot of features to make listening a pleasure.,positive
recent update has removed the widget. but why? bring it back because people use it!,negative
I love this app because it's the ultimate music library old school new school all genres and I can get the complete album s,positive
Spotify is my go to for music streaming! It helps me calm down and I personally enjoy Spotify.,positive
"Spotify has been great so far except I can only get to skip song x5 then I can't, I just have to lister to what I don't want to listen.",negative
"The amount of glitches recently are ridiculous!!! I've been Premium member for years and this is a joke lately with how the info bar-play, pause etc. all disappear during songs and podcasts now with no way of selecting anything other than to close the app. I've had to uninstall and install the app several times and it keeps happening. Shape up Spotify we expect more from you.",negative
I really like this app because I'm the type of person who likes to listen to music when studying so this keeps me a little more happy :),positive
Difficulty in opening acct and profile tabs in app.,negative
"whenever i make a playlist, spotify just randomly adds songs and i can never restart my playlist and listen to the songs i actually want to listen to",negative
Always has the music I'm looking for and great recommendations as well,positive
Amazing service. I love the new updates! This is by far my favorite streaming service. I have set up so many of my friends and family on here now. They all love it!,positive
Best app for music! The free version is itself well enough and you can listen songs from various artists and it is really cool. The UI is simple and you can customize the app's interiorâ¤ï¸..I love this app!,positive
Very slow loading times since the update.,negative
You guys need to really work on ads!!!!! Please reduce them!! After listening to 2 songs 3 ads start to play which annoys a lot and disturbs the whole ongoing musical mood!! Either reduce them or atleast give an option to skip them!! It's a advice to you... because you may lose many of your users because of these ads! Plzzzzzz reduce them!!!,negative
Just my music when I what it. Albums as well as my favorite only. Make own Playlist/ multiple .,negative
I love Spotify because when u go to YouTube to listen to music u can exit the app and listen. But with spotify u can do that so that's why Spotify is a good app,positive
"Music selection is good, app is shocking. So many bugs. Podcasts stopping for no reason, mini player in notification panel disappearing, play / pause button and up next selection disappearing.",positive
Absolutely loving it The premium offers so much more and on top of it it is quite affordable So for everyone whos complaining Id only say that they need money to keep alive their business but people only think about themselves empty your pockets a little bit The sound quality and and range of music is great plus we get podcasts on the same app which is a perk,positive
This is a lovely music listening app!,positive
The only problem is that sometimes the adds start playing before the song finishes. Wich really gets on my nerves sometimes especially when the ending is the best part of the song But other than that the app deserves five stars,positive
Very useful all music I wanted choose no problem,positive
Spotify keeps stopping or becoming unresponsive along with other bugs like unable to pause your music,negative
Too much advertisement.......and playlists are not perfect...there are another songs too in a particular playlist.......,negative
Very quick and easy. Love it!,positive
Just get it,positive
Couldn't ask for better selection personalization and easy to use,negative
Ill give this a 1 star because first of all this app is annoying when you make your own Playlist instead of listening on the skng that u added this a annoying different song played this so annoying i have to use all of my free skip to play the music that i wanted and second of all when you search a music then after u click it instead of playing the music that i reached another music was played c'mon what the heck is this i just wanted to listen to the music that i added and search for so please,negative
I just want to play my music or skip my music or even see what song is playing. The app has been completely broken for me and everyone I know for the last week.,negative
Adds songs to a playlist that i dont want songs added to,positive
"Good, this could be much better if we can Play karoke track & sing songs!ðŸ˜Š",negative
"Latest update has bugs, as others have reported. Very frustrating. Please fix asap!",negative
"Horrible and SUCKS suddenly when i listen on my phone. Inserting songs into my Playlist that I've never added anywhere. Won't let me listen to my Playlist at all, or only hear snippets. If I try to skip through, I can't because I get the pop-up to buy premium. THAT'S NOT MOTIVATING ME TO BUY PREMIUM. Jesus, just fix it.",negative
Better than any music streaming service I can look up any song on here and it has it While other apps dont have near as many songs as Spotify definitely worth getting,positive
"There is a problem that in notifications, album art of a different song is shown when music is playing.",negative
Its good. One of the Legal free music apps :),positive
As soon as I play either Bluetooth speaker or an alexa device it consistently changes the up coming songs as I skip forward so the up next is constantly shuffled.,negative
Am stuck at offline mode(which i never chose) and now i can't log into my spotify account in my phone..it only works on my laptopðŸ˜£,negative
IT is a great great great experience with Spotify and it can tell us story . I am impressed with spotify ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,positive
I'm a man who tries to take the bad with the good but to be completely honest. This app on PS4 is FAR superior to this version which demands money for everything. Where as on PS4 I have more freedom on here it's like this is it deal with it.,positive
"If I want to unsubscribe from premium... Why do I have to open my account in web browser? App must have that functionality, that saves time and effort, improves customer experience in a few words...",negative
"I mean like I can't repeat songs anymore, and I'm trying to fix it but I don't know how, I went to settings and tried everything but nothing worked so help me please?",negative
"It's a good app with premium but as soon as it runs out you have ads and you can't skip songs if you do it to much for a hour, A FLIPPING HOUR!! so I only really recommend if you can afford premium",positive
"Too Good. This music app is by far, easy to navigate, has a huge selection of what ever genre you're in the mood for and just all around COOL!",positive
The free version sucks so bad. Only 6 skips an hour + the 17 million ads that play every second + not even getting to pick what song you want. I'm not paying 10 dollars a month to get what should be the default. Just make premium a one time buy. Also get rid of like 90% of the ads and let me listen to the music on this so called music app.,negative
Great music app I have ever seen,positive
Don't know why i can't use the app anymore. The screen always stuck at the logo,negative
Awesome music display. I wish I could get more free music time,positive
Was working great. Upgraded to premium and now it stops playing halfway through. Or starts playing without displaying what's playing or any controls for what's playing,negative
The app is amazing but in a playlist they add random songs the that says recommend for you can you please do somthing about it please,positive
I've always had a great experience using Spotify for all my music and podcast needs.,positive

I love the app ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥° so easy to do find my favorite rappers with their best songs 1ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜,positive
"The free version sucks, I mean the recommendations for the children are inappropriate and they just play in the playlist and likes songs not happy.",negative
Nice ,positive
"I really hate how it adds extra songs to your playlists. I have to constantly go through and take them all off. I make my playlists how I like them and don't need your input. Also, the ads are far too loud. Why are that so much louder than the music? I have my music quite quiet when using headphones but the ads pop up and I have to take my headphones off because it hurts my ears.",negative
I really love this app because all of the songs I want is in their.,positive
"It's an awesome app but recently I've been experiencing a lot of crashes, music stopping halfway, the play and pause buttons keep disappearing",negative

I have emailed Spotify for answers as, like others have said, I will cancel my subscription and use another provider for streaming. Samsung Galaxy user.",negative
Todella hyv,positive
Excellent,positive
"Good when it works, but since upgrading to an S21 I have to reinstall every 2 days because the play/pause widget stops working, and the playing bar disappears front he bottom of the app. Reading the reviews this seems a common theme with the o lyrics solution being ""reinstall the app""",negative
"A perfectly meh experience. Often while playing a podcast the app won't register anything is playing so if I'm distracted I can't rewind or pause. Debatable if this is better than apple podcast player... This glitches a lot but it plays podcasts in sequence, apple podcast you have full control but it plays podcasts backwards ie: it'll play episode 9 after episode 10",positive
wonderful,positive
"The option to play a clip of the song before I add it to a playlist was taken off, which helped in finding new music that I actually like. This was a big part in why I kept the app rather than just use soundcloud or youtube...",negative

"I love Spotify and have been a user for years. I have even converted everyone I can to Spotify. Just in time for the worst experience so far. For the last month or so it has been garbage. It doesn't update my daily mixes regularly or will update them randomly, the listed songs rarely match what actually plays and the player itself keeps disappearing until I force close the app so that I can change songs and things again. Please please please fix.",negative
Too much ads,negative
"The app is great but after the updates, mobile data doesn't work for Spotify now and it thinks I'm offline.",negative
Spotify gets worse and worse every goddamn update!! Like if you search for a song it doesnt even play it! Because its apparently on shuffle. And if you play it on a playlist it'll immediately go to the part you were on instead of reseting and you cant even change it because if you go out of the playlist it will no longer play!,negative

"Podcast part is not useful. Make it more like other podcast apps! I want to see the popularity and rating in the search. Too buggy on Galaxy S20.. often too slow, feezes, stops reacting to buttons. But this could be fixed in the phone settings.",negative
"I've been using Spotify premium for years, its very easy to use and very convenient but these day it started to lagging quiet a lot and took time to open the app which makes me felt kinda frustrated about it. At first I thought it was my internet problem but then other app that required internet connection works perfectly fine. I happened to see other spotify users review, seems like they also face same thing like me. I hope it will be fix soon.",negative
Good songs. Plays well. Repeats same ads back to back... not paying for premium so i expect ads not the same one over and over and over.,negative
"Latest update (4/5/22) has lots of issues: Now Playing/Queue disappears. Crashes/freezes suddenly. Can't open Playback Device, blanks out.",negative
To much ads.. when you play any song after the song the ads will show you evry time.. I think the cheapest app of listen the song...ðŸ˜¡,negative
Adds irritating continuosly.. rest is good.,positive

I put this on one star bcz it contains ads and when I press a song I like it puts a random song://,negative

My favorite music app. Love the integration withany other apps and services and the variety it offers.,positive
love it,positive
I actually liked this app until it got worse . I used to play a whole 4 min song while now it's playing only 10 seconds of the song . I am really disappointed that you need premium for the whole song and I can't make my account premium....,negative
"I left Spotify for Tidal a while back, and returned to Spotify a month ago to find it has improved immensely.",positive
Annoying algorithm that replays things I used to enjoy. Hardly any divergence espically for people who only get music from the application from my observation. While this puts emphasis on exploration i prefer discovery to be effecinet. My understanding on this topic isn't high but is it not possible to create additional ones with different logics? Other than that it is a decent music streaming service.,negative
Good but without premium there is a lot of ads and I can't listen to the song I want,positive
"Best music app. Ecosystem of this app is very convenient, seamless connection with PlayStation and smart TVs.",positive
"It's great.. selection is ðŸ˜ love that it continues to play when the phone screen closes! Only complaint is all the ads, but it's free, so I can't complain to much ðŸ˜",positive
"Even on high speed internet this app shows ""no internet connection""",negative
Amazing app!!! Hard to add song to playlist.,negative
Needs comments. The JRE is glitchey af Stability of app sucks fix one thing makes something else worse.,negative
"Extra-ordinary, extraordinary ready when I'm ready letting me explore the Stars like Observatory",positive
"New update full of bugs as other reviewers have noted, now for several days. Playback stops, current song and bar to skip or like.",negative
Still the best music streaming platform. Options for undergroung artists grow with Spotify for Artists!,positive
"Spotify became my number one music app, as soon as I learned how they stood up for free speech. Neil Young threatened to pull his music off Spotify, if they did not remove Joe Rogan, for what Mr Young claimed as misinformation about the vaccine. We the people are so fed up with this nonsense and suppression of free speech. This is America and it will not stand. Thank you Spotify. I have deleted YouTube music.",negative
"Crashes constantly, doesn't display the podcast you are actually listening to, pause and play button doesn't work most of the time. Trash.",negative
"I have a lot of songs liked in Spotify. Unfortunately, at times the app will start playing songs I've never heard of and have not liked. When I go into Spotify and tap on my library and select my liked songs, I expect the app to play only my liked songs. If the app does not stop playing songs that I have not liked, then I will uninstall the app and find another. Also, Spotify keeps stopping and I don't like that.",negative
That is very good song lestining app.,positive
Always makes it easy to get music of the mood,positive
I was listening to one musician and the app started playing other music and I couldn't change it or pass. Not impressed.,negative

The shuffle mode is terrible it only plays maybe 1/2 the songs over and over again!,negative
I was paying for the same thing I get from Spotify. Will never leave! Spotify also recommend like selections I may not have thought of,positive
I was in shower while listening to rap music then the song changed and put a Morgan Wallen song on which is country music they need to fix the song chooser but besides that I love spotify. I had the app at 3 star because of my first encounter with country music then I went to my liked songs shuffled them and received Taylor swift I have now deleted spotify and will never download it again.,negative
The app has been great so far. I am changing my review from 2 stars to 5 because they have fixed the bugs so far. Thank you,positive
Won't play other songs after clicking the play button and I can't figure out where to turn off shuffle for my liked Playlist.,negative
Completely broken on a Samsung S22. I understand android fragmentation is a challenge but it's still disappointing to see Spotify doesn't do basic QA on the most common brands.,negative
Great variety of good quality music ! I have discovered new music I have not heard before. Recommended and new album picks are good. The playlists are easy to use.,positive
I use Spotify to stream podcasts and listen to music. It's very easy to use and really the best streaming service I've come across. 5 Stars.,positive
I had a good experience ðŸ˜Œ in listening the song it's makes me ðŸ˜Š happy and relax me and one thing I Don't need to care about the screen off because when it's screen off it's playing on and it is auto shuffling ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ,negative
My downloads often get removed when I turn on my phone. Sometimes the playlist skips songs.,negative
I'm rating this 2 stars whenever I keep skipping the song that is NOT in my playlist its still keeps letting me listen to another song that isn't in my playlist its quite annoying.. It's just I can't buy the premium but I want to listen to my own playlist so please fix it.,negative

"Had Spotify for years, but recently when I play a song from an album/playlist, it plays 1 song then goes off playing a completely random song, not from any playlist I have. Will be ditching soon, not worth the hassle.",negative
So bad I just want my songs so when I made a new play list to get rid of all the songs they added it literally put 500 extra song I rate one or zero,negative
Cool. Played for background while bridge ladies were here. They wanted to know about it. So I showed them that I had it on my phone. They loved it.,positive

Who ever makes the playlists has no taste and uses the same few songs. Shuffle algorithm is nonrandom. The app stops playing and closes frequently,negative
I like to be able to open app and my songs be there,positive
It connects great to my Google devices and great for on the go once you download your Playlist.,positive
This app sucks. I just want to listen to my music even with the ads. I dont want to listen to beiber.,negative

"Truly amazing app..has become part of my day to dÃ y life activities,,,,,",positive

Simply the best,positive
"I give 2 star cuz in this app had a issues. I can't skip to another song, I can't choose other songs, it shuffled itself automatically in my smartphone. Maybe, u can add no ads, download song & listen to the songs in offline in Spotify Premium but u added all features in Spotify Premium. Then, how people can listen to their fav songs. Please fix this issue. I hope you will fix it.",negative
Despite having to re download liked songs and having to go through all my music again. Its been pleasant,positive
Not working while connected to Wi-Fi. Already updated the App & reinstalled too. Very bad,negative
"Great to find albums and songs that a person can't find anywhere else, not even on YouTube.",positive

I love it I can play my music whenever I want to and loud as I want to and nobody has to hear it thank you Spotify,positive
"I used to like spotify before, but now I don't. You can't even play your chosen song. All you have is a playlist chosing random songs for you. I think Soundcloud is doing better than you.",negative
Love Spotify. Try it and tell me you don't like it!,negative
Love the app but sometimes my playlist won't work,negative
"This ""intuitive"" app is worthless. The only good thing is its library, and its barely that. Update: still worthless. 7/7/2022",negative
I was great then i had to get premium and it stopped working,negative
What happened??? I can't pause it anymore. When I play something I don't get any of the buttons showing up on my phone. I can't pause and it won't even show what I'm listening to. I've even had it play right over other apps like books. It's become complete garbage.,negative
"Not all songs I like can be found on spotify, like live versions, two examples: live version of ChloeXHalle ungodly hour, or Mumford and sons the enemy. Sometimes the music wont play the downloads offline. The app bothered me to rate, so here you are.",negative

Best music streaming app. Its the one that connects easiest to my car's bluetooth.,positive

"Great, useful, but too many ads and not 30 mins in between ads like promised in the ads.",negative
"Yall removed the option to view an albums tracklist and preview songs and add them to playlists. Bring it back. Also, why are they Disney advertisements at twice the volume? Could you please adjust the audio?",negative
"I love Spotify, premium is the best, however, I have downloaded playlists that don't keep all the songs in said playlist downloaded. Every time I get a connection of some sort, everything is downloaded again, it makes no sense. Anybody understanding what I'm saying?",negative
"Sound quality is horrible compared with competitors, i would expect at least cd 96khz 24bitrate audio quality wich they claim to have but compared with qobuz there's a clear difference in quality.",positive
"Spotify is a great app,I Think We All Sgoyld Have It.",positive
I like the old version,positive

Pretty good app ðŸ¥° but I Don't Like The Shuffle But Otherwise Great App Cuz You Can Make Your Own Playlist And Listen To Music ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,positive
"Great app of course, but there's a new bug since about a week. The play bar at the bottom disappears, or never even appears at all. Same with the music card in my notification shade (BT buttons then don't work either). Music does play and there is no lag, but if i want to skip a song I have to clear the app about once or twice, only to lose it again after some half hour. OP7pro It even begins to quit around twice a day during studying, needing me to restart the app",negative
Best place for music and podcasts!,positive

It was great before but now it started irritating the users You cannot repeat the same song cant listen to the particular parts by moving backward or forward and after a certain limit you are not able to play the song of your choice I dont know if it was just too make people buy the premium plan I reccomend you to download some other music app Before Spotify was reccomended because it was the best one but now other apps are recommended as they are better than this one,positive
"It's very frustrating, keeps crashing, stops and starts randomly.",negative
"Too many pop ups, adverts ever 3 songs for the free version and they're the same adverts. YouTube isn't this bad!",negative
"I've had premium for a long time now, with a seamless experience. However, it's becoming unusable on my Android phone. The play function just isn't working at times, which seems pretty fundamental to a music streaming service. I have to keep reinstalling the app to get basic functionality or use my Sonos to override my phone. Once a track is playing, the currently playing doesn't appear, which means you can't stop a track. The only way is to force stop. Looking for alternative services.",negative
Very good app for streming music,positive
Easy search and complete list of artists.,negative
"Out of all the music apps I have tried , Spotify is the best it has all the songs ur looking for, easy to find and save, it's worth the download.",positive
I am very enjoying this app.A best app for listening music ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘,positive
How come my user name is changed after I paid for premium version. I already paid for the premium version using the last user name but cannot use the premium version because the username is confusing and very different. I log in a few times but have no result and my money gone :((,negative
Songs downloaded does not get stored in device. It remains in app library.,negative
Enjoy using this app to listen to pod casts and music.,positive
Change the outlook of Spotify on Android version,negative
"It's a music app that does its job, playing music",positive
I've been using Spotify for years. Didn't have very many complaints over that time until recently. The glitches have been ridiculous. To me one of the basic requirements for an app is that it doesn't crash a dozen times a day. This app has not been meeting that requirement. I have started researching other music streaming apps and will definitely switch if things don't get better soon.,negative
Overall a great app to use for music and podcasts,positive
Best experience while playing music But you guys should upgrade on music shuffling,negative
"I hate this app now like seriously after the new update it's all changed like I can't even repeat the song and it's all in a playlist and it all pissed me off I deleted this app and I'm using another apps to listen songs cuz who would like to pay for songs, there are more appsðŸ™„",negative

Perfection,positive
Brilliant fantastic play all day.,positive
"All songs free , what needed more !!!",positive
It's such a great experience. I love the Options that it changes with my moods,positive
Overall I think it's fine but the main thing that really bothers me is that that you have to have premium to skip songs I mean that's dumb you should be able to skip a song when you want to instead of having to pay for premium just to skip a song that you want to listen to.,negative
It's my favorite music app tho sometimes the music just randomly pauses idk if it's just my phone other then that it's really good â™¡Â´ï½¥á´—ï½¥`â™¡,positive

The only one thing I don't like about it... Is it doesn't have Smoke and mirrors by Black veil brides. But other than that 5 stars,positive
You HAVE TO check out The Danny Diess Show Podcast! Amazingly funny with great Vinyl!,positive
Freezes constantly. Offline mode is poorly implemented. Should default to this mode when connectivity is lost to let me play what I have downloaded.,negative
"I keep trying to listen to music. So basically I pick a song and it automatically just switches to a random song. This is pretty annoying to me and I'm getting really upset and it is freaking me out how I can't just pick one song. And many ads pop up before I even get the chance to pick one. And The interrupted listening isn't even close to 30 Minutes and still annoys me. I barely use this app anymore and I need Spotify to fix this. Until then, 3 stars for Spotify.",negative
Spotify is great has so many wonderful playlists,positive
"Its good for the most and i use this app every day but keeps on playing over other apps when spotify 'was not suppost to be open' and it comes randomly and then skips songs at random. It also deleted a few of my favourite songs from a show i liked and i dont have premium so i dont get to listen to them ever again... with all of this though i still really like the app because of how easy it is to use and i love the karaoke feature,,, ads r a bit over the top tho",positive
I love being able to set up my own station and song lists for free. I also love the premium but I'm poor and homeless so I can't afford it. But all the way around my favorite app,negative
Can' connect with my samsung galaxy note 10 plus with kenwood after update. It still show connecting and song is playing.,negative
Ever since the update the app has been acting weird. It won't show the play bar but will play anyway. Sometimes it just randomly stops playing. Usually if Bluetooth disconnects it will pause the song but now it will just keep playing. Worked pretty good before the update on 4/5/22,positive
will not stop auto playing after force stops,positive

Ever ready music app at all time.,positive
Used Spotify as premium and non premium for a few years now... All of a sudden I get 6-8 ads (30 seconds per ad) every 2 or 3 songs.... Getting rather unbearable... Please sort this out.... Its getting a bit irritating... I don't mind a few ads or even 6-8 ads each 30min length but it's 6-8 ads every 2-3 songs or approx 6-10 mins (song length dependant) Getting to the point of account closure and delete now.... Please fix it.,negative
I just can't understand how it works He doesn't give the song when I ask for it He puts a lot of songs in front of me and I can't get over it ðŸ’€,negative

"Music removed. App keeps asking to connect Bluetooth and no option to turn off the message. Button layout changed, looks unfriendly and ugly.",negative
"Still extremely slow when changing storage to external sd card.. I'm convinced this is done on purpose, spotify knows of this issue and has done NOTHING to solve it! Over time I have changed sd cards, each being faster in read, write speeds(all samsung brand). And please add ""don't like song"" so it will never appear again in my searches or playlists.",negative
"Now its finally not broken as much, but now a new problem is that some songs dont show up, but when you click edit on a playlist it shows THAT IT IS INFACT THERE,",negative
This app is good but pls make an update where i can delete recent played pls PLSS I BEG YOU,negative

Great app. Even without premium you still get options. I listen to podcasts on this app and it is great...so many options and no ads while in the middle of podcasts. Occasionally the music does not play without wifi even though its downloaded,positive
absolutely love it. just never ever make the app like social media... we love only music to be here..,positive
too many ads....even after 1 song ads apear.....jio saavn is much better that this,negative
It is a really good streaming service to listen to any song that you can for free. But the function to filter the liked playlist isn't working. I don't know why as this is a useful feature. I'm not sure if this is the same for everyone else though. But other than that it is possibly the best music streaming service there is.,positive
Awesome music with older an new music they have live an nonlive music making it great sound an great tunes to listen to on the road,positive
App is nice only if you have premium membership otherwise you will be irritated by adds,negative
I enjoy all the choices and quality of the music!,positive
I love it ,positive
Very boring UI. Need to make it colorful and responsive. Creating playlist is troublesome and can't be found once created. I always need to get to Desktop Spotify to check my playlist.,negative
Easy to navigate and has things I actually want to listen to.,positive
"I love this app. I can always find the music I want to find and it really helped me find my music taste. But the ads! When I skip through an ad, another ad pops up when I don't need that 30 mins of free ads. It's obnoxious.",negative
Nice app but ads is problem,negative
Simply put.. Spotify > every other music stuff you know,positive
"App keeps crashing on X70 pro plus just by ""PLAYING ANY SONG "", really irritating.",negative
I PROMISE I WILL PAY FOR SPOTIFY PREMIUM GIVE ME 5 MORE DAYS I PROMISE,positive
When ever I try to play a song app itself exit and a I m unable to play song,negative
Hi Can I download music from Spotify and listen in other players. I mean having the mp3 file that can be shared,negative
"Amazing app, premium has been very worth it but for the past few months since March or April I keep on getting bizarre pauses and break ups when listening to music downloaded or streamed. App also just crashes too. It's gotten unusually buggy recently and hard to use, would be great to get this fixed",negative
"Amazing quality, with all my favourite music.",positive
It's my favorite app for listening to my podcast and music,positive
It's alot here everything. I couldn't imagine .I'm so musical,positive
"Absolute garbage. This app banned Donald Trump, the true president of the United States. It also has nonsensical podcasts about racist, white-hating, leftist, communist trash. Not to mention you can't listen to music on here. This app is only for ads. One song plays, then an advertisement. Another song, then another ad. Delete this trash app and start again",negative
"Extremely Poorly Optimised. Autoplays the same song always, unintuitive navigation to artist album releases etc.",negative
Bruh fix your app it keeps crashing while i play some music,negative
1 Star because reordering a playlist on Android is the most unintuitive thing I've seen in a very long time.,negative
Sound cloud is better than ads free  once try and say thanks again,positive
"New update, where has the pause, now playing, stop start button gone. Dreadful update, have to fully close app to stop.",negative
"Oh Spotify, how I love thee. I listen to music a lot and Spotify has it all.",positive
I have been using Spotify for many years now and even pay every month for one of their plans. Never had a complaint until now. I cant access anything. It keeps saying No WiFi Connection but there is and seems like I am not the only one. The worst part is I contacted the company and not helpful at all. Canceling my subscription and have moved back to I heart radio and Pandora.,negative
"Pause and play banner disappears within Spotify app. Cannot turn off podcast or music except by closing app, which is ridiculous. Also, no simple option to play just one podcast, rather than being bombarded by countless episodes on an autoplay. Spotify seems to lack technical nous. Even Acast allowed only one episode to play without issue.",negative
Directs one quickly to music without undergoing many steps,positive
"Usually brilliant but a recent update has caused issues. My downloaded music keeps deleting and, more importantly, whenever the app is playing music in the background it's causing stability issues in my (Samsung A53 5G) phone and causing it to restart, constantly, it's very irritating. I spent ages thinking it was my phone, or other apps, but through a process of elimination (deleting and disabling apps, putting my phone in safe mode etc etc) I've tracked the problem to Spotify. Please fix",negative
"Newest update made the app unusable. It deleted all my saved songs and the bar at the bottom (with play and skip songs) disappeared and the only way to get it back is to force stop the app. This happens around 20 times per day. As of April 21st this issue is still happening. Deletes my downloads everyday. Freezes constantly. As of April 25th its still happening. Haven't been contacted, do you even care about the service you offer?",negative
"They try to make you buy premium on phones by implementing the worst features imaginable, like forcefully modifying your Playlist, not allowing you to play the same song twice in a row, and numerous others. I can beat with ads and understand why they are there, but seeing them throw all the features onto phone exclusively is disgusting. If you want to get spotify, get it on iPad or tablet as it has many of the same features as premium on phone, just with ads.",negative
This one pick this over all other music apps,negative
"bring back the preview song option in the add songs because making playlists without it is literally the biggest pain. ads are okay! but I do not see the point of only letting us shuffle on mobile. I can just use my computer to choose what I wanna listen, or switch to another music app that lets me choose my songs instead of making me shuffle my playlist. if it weren't for these issues it would've been a 5 star review.",negative
"I'm a premium user and I love the app. But for the past one week, It has been showing 'no internet connection' and my network is very good. Please fix this.",positive
Best music app I've have the opportunity of using. Absolutely amazing!,positive
Seems like a lot of pod cast are missing lately.,negative
"I have always adored spotify! I pay for premium, but I must say the whole ""hide this song"" option is getting really annoying being right beside save and add to Playlist. I have accidentally hid songs I've been trying to save and add to playlist",negative
This thing was working dor about a few weeks then it stopped now it wont play the songs anymore. I dont recomend this,negative
Ive had Spotify for a good while until they started charging way to much for premium i was paying 1069 and I wish they would go back to paying that I really liked Spotify alot I canceled my premium and I have Soundcloud I really like Soundcloud its great,positive
"I want to play a song and its playing similar songs like I asked for a playlistðŸ˜­. Not worth the hype, getting uninstalled from all my devices. Get apple music or YouTube music instead. Not worth the frustrationâ›·.",negative
Great app. Listen all day while at work. Not using premium but still great app.,positive
It's pretty good but to many ads,positive
"Ever since the most recent update I've been experiencing glitches constantly. When I'm playing music the play/pause/skip panel at the bottom (in app) and in my phone notification panel disappears. Struggles to content to my car through bluetooth,and music will randomly cut out.",negative
"Best music app by far. The recommendations they provide, as well as the diversity and the best thing, the only ads are those for other music.",positive
"What is missing HIFI music and a customised sleep timer, otherwise its the best music app to cater for music",negative
"If I were to compare, Spotify is the best music app for me. I love the interface sm! Although there are some bugs and stuffs, they didn't hinder me much from having a good experience in this app. I hope you'd add more songs and improve the sound quality just like AM (it's already good but I don't think it would hurt if you make it better hehe)",positive
The UI for podcasts is horrible and it never remembers where I was. Thank goodness the JRE is the only Spotify exclusive podcast that I listen to!,negative
"Great music selection, however the ease of use for the listener is not there. The little things like not being able to clear the queue of the the playlist you were playing and not being able to and random songs to the queue dampen the experience of the app. Also the lack of response to helpful suggestions by the developers is also a problem.",negative
"Apparently I'm not the only one with this issue but when I go to another app it will stop playing music, even though I pay for premium. Or it won't show what's being played when I'm in the app. Please fix this it's been doing this since the update and it's really annoying I'm considering changing services. IM GETTING SO TIRED OF HAVING TO CLICK PLAY BECAUSE IT KEEPS PAUSING ITS SELF WHEN YALL GONNA FIX THIS",negative
This is the best music stream app ever â¤,positive
Excellent app! Very user friendly.,positive
Easy to use app. Great to listen to the music you like.,positive
"Since last update I have lost the controls for track play, stop etc. Without this functionality, what's the point in paying for this app!! I have a samsung phone and the app has worked flawlessly up to now. Really, really annoying. Please sort this out or I'll be cancelling my subscription.",negative
I was able to build up my playlists with tons of songs from several cultures and languages. Thanks Spotify!!,positive
This is best app ever with no ads and we can listen unlimited songs in every language this app is realy bestâ£ï¸â¤ï¸,positive
La aplicacin es muy buena se descarga rpido las musicas y por ejemplo si estoy escuchando msica y se va el wifi ni se pausan mus musicas descargadas,positive
Best music app ever!,positive
Great app to listen to music.,positive
Me and my friend cannot seem to make a blend playlist. The link just redirects us to the home screen of the app regardless of the link sender,positive
Nice,positive
The new update for the phones is not like it is on Ipad,negative
"Used it for years, but there are so many problems with the app at the moment that make it extremely frustrating to use.",negative
I have downloaded the Spotify app on my Android phone and it gets stuck at the Spotify logo. I've restarted my phone a few times. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I've forced stop the app and restart it again. I'm connected to the internet. Nothing works. It remained stuck at the Spotify logo.,negative
"Usually love the app, since the new update has been crashing and just overall not functioning. New update needs to be undone and re evaluated.",negative
"This app is pretty good. I am able to search any songs I want and it has different audios to listen to. On my lap top it works perfectly, but on mobile there are too many ads. Overall it's a pretty good app.",positive
Very nice  ,positive
"Love the app it has a lot of good music, but I had to uninstall amd reinstall it because whenever my phone would fall asleep the music would stop. I had to uninstal and reinstal the app to get it to stop doimg this. Also, the adds, I really don't like the adds. I also don't like how you have to be connected to WIFI to be able to listen to music, you can only do that if you buy the Premium Pass.",negative
I love setting the atmosphere with exactly what I want to hear and I can do that with Spotify.,positive
It's awesome platform for music.,positive
"fix this stupid app man. i just wanna listen to music of MY choice but I'm getting forced to listen to random songs added by this app on my playlist. + no one wants to pay just to skip songs so make ot for free. when i remove i song from my playlist, it still plays and this app bugs too much. again, fix this god forsaken app",negative
The app does this thing where it doesn't allow me to rewind and re listen to bits I may have missed on podcasts especially.,negative
Podcast are great and as far as music there's a multitude of genre to choose from,positive
This app sucks they add songs to my albums that I don't want like I made an album from the songs of Christopher Escalante and I Can't play it thanks to the Trash songs the Spotify added They should not add song to other people's Albums and they should make the limited Skipping to 20,negative
"Was good but now it just doesn't show what's playing, plays randomly in my pocket or car and constantly cuts out for 5 second intervals.",negative
Works really well. It has nearly everything I want/search for. YouTube still holds the title for the most music though.,positive
"Skipping during every song, especially on lock screen. Typically won't play it at all on lock screen. Please fix!",negative
It is an awesome app for songs,positive
"Very easy to use for me, high quality, Spotify Premium is a great deal that I enjoy using every day. Recommend to anyone using their phone to hear music on a daily basis.",positive
No longer works with my car stereo and this is where I mainly use it Have to use it via bluetooth which means you cant skip tracks without touching your phone which is illegal in the UK. Please fix!,negative
Very good app only 1 break then half an our no breaks,positive
Love Spotify. I especially like how Spotify exposes me to music that I would normally never hear on commercial radio. Totally recommend,positive
This app won't let me log back in. Tgis and the spotify for artists app. I'm not sure what to do,negative
Every updat makes things worse. If I could give 0 stars I would and somehow that would be too many,negative
Really enjoying my choice of music,positive
It's been down for 2 days and when it's up it takes FOREVER to load. And I pay for the service,negative
The app is good But the intersting fact is that their most of the ads are to remove their ads And the add is very much frequent One time will come their ads will be displayed within 1 min and the ads duration will be 2 mins,negative
They took away support for my car radio for absolutely no reason.,negative
Endless rest music - love it. Thank you!!,positive
I've had Spotify for 5+ years... I tried out Amazon Music & even tho I canceled it several times & they keep on charging me I cldnt let go of MY SPOTIFY!! I'm hooked! ðŸ’ƒ,negative
Problem is am finding it difficult to play music in my play list. And it's impossible to repeat or play a previous song. Is it that I don't know how to use this app or what?,negative
Spotify hasn't Always been in My Life. When I was a kid it was all about Cassettes and CDs. Now I can't Imagine a Life without Spotify. My Playlists are a Part of Me & to Me that's Priceless.,positive
Amazing app for those who love music ðŸŽ¶.... But sometimes there will be some glitches... But not all the time ðŸ˜‰... If u r reading reviews to download this app then just go and download this application â˜ºï¸ðŸ‘.,positive
"App plays random songs in your playlist and plays ""suggested songs"" even though you have more than 15 songs in your playlist. Skipping these songs brings up more ""suggested songs."" Without premium, this app is so useless I could go to YouTube and get more value.",negative
"The app lately is horrible. So many small bugs, the music plays but when I open the app I don't see the buttons to stop or play backwards/forward. Having issues every time I plug any Bluetooth headset. Really annoying",negative
Surprising,positive
Every like 2 or 3 songs you get 4 ads and it's so annoying that you can't pick the songs that you want to listen and now you can't listen to the songs you whant to add to you Playlist,negative
To many ads but overall a good app,positive
By getting the no ads it makes listening to music better,negative
A very good app but there are some songs missing and so many ads we used to face while listening to the music I know ads are important for your business but too many ads are not good show people limited ads after 15 or 20 mins u can run ads but not after every song change,negative
"Another bug !!! 11/1/22 Already add music to my liked song from my phone, than i cant find that song in my liked album in my spotify tablet. even my phone and tab doesnt sync playing now !!!! hate it soooo much. and seems like my spotify tablet disconnected totally to internet *offline. I dont want to uninstall or reset the apps cz im on cellular now it will gonna be so much data need to re download the whole my liked songs !!!!! WORST !!!! even apple music play so much clear song ssssht",negative
I enjoy Spotify I like the way that you can set up your music library I also like the 30 minutes free of commercials and ads CRT,positive
Best music /podcasts app ever I use it every night to fall asleep to my favorite songs<3,positive
I like music and Podcasts that brings back nostalgia.,positive
Best among any other music app,positive
The app would not let me play my liked songs instead just random now im mad please help,negative
"Lost of small bugs and glitches, the app is almost useless to use without premium and some features are hard to use. Even with premium it's quite bad. When I started using the app years ago I would've gave it a 4 - 5 star rating as you could use the free version of the app much more freely, there weren't many bugs and the app was overall just better.",negative
"I use it often, will continue to do so. The app keeps pausing every 10 min, even in offline mode. It's annoying and abrupt, this needs to be fixed.",negative
its a good app but somtimes the ads are kind of annoying but its good for the music amazming use,negative
This is an amazing app where I can listen to music and I recommend it to people who love songs!,positive
"While one can get good quality music for free, it contains a great amount of disruptive ads that just won't stop. Overall this app is only good if one has a premium package.",positive
"The songs will not show in created playlists, only the artists. Also won't work with searching. Was fine on my tablet but just installed it on my new phone for convenience and was very disappointed.",negative
"Much easier for me to deal with some of the other streaming services; however, I do like the ease of accessing the songs I'm looking for and setting up Playlists.",positive
The only thing I don't like is I can't pick the song I want to play and I can't change from shuffle play to just playing from the first song to the last,negative
"It wouldn't let me sign in, kept telling me I have no internet connection. Then when I did get in, after I select the episode I want to listen to, it keeps skipping through all episodes until it gets to the end of the playlist. Then it just starts playing random songs! I do not want Dermot Kennedy thank you very much..",negative
I love Spotify!,positive
Love the music ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ easy to navigate..,positive
"Great app and has tons of music. It could be better if the shuffle function actually worked. When shuffling songs, it'll take the top songs of an artist and shuffle only those songs or it will repeat each song twice.",negative
There is one problem when I like my songs that I like I want to play them on shuffle but then there is other songs that it plays I don't like it makes me angry but after all the app is very good,positive
GOOD,positive
Pls stop adding songs that i dont like,negative
"They insist on throat-f***ing you with podcasts, even though I couldn't care less about them as they aren't what I'm paying for. If they'd at least make it a section of the app instead of the first 10 rows you see when you open it, I'd totally change the review.",negative
They charged my card without my permission I didn't sign up for premium,negative
Very convenient for me coz I get to listen to the songs that I love back from the past. Classic man here! ðŸ˜Š,positive
Great app with all genres of music!,positive
"Good music and lots of it for a good price, the story of how they got started is interesting too.",positive
The app stops working randomly. And also stops playing the song like countless times. It cannot to car anymore lately. It is getting worse and worse to listen to music on this app. The shuffle button is damn annoying and the display function when the phone is locked does not always appear. It is so arbitrary.,negative
Good app but can't play previews,positive
"I find it freeing because of the variety of music, & reasonably priced.",positive
Its so easy to use and its so awesome bc i get to prank my friends that i was a VIP anyway i found some of my fav songs nice app,positive
"It has been great since I purchased premium but some of my songs don't get downloads I don't know what is wrong, can't see lyrics when offline and some of the songs are know where to be found like Park Jimin's promise and others. Before premium was hell like it has more ads than any other apps I've ever encountered, at one point i thought i might break my phone when ads came out of nowhere but everything is good now I guess except for those things i mentioned right above.",positive
This app is SO SO COOL i can search what i want to play a SONG!!!,positive
Good without premium,positive
"There is actually no way to see all songs from an artist, as the songs they were featured on are not in their discography. The ""Appears on"" section is not organized by release date, it's a jumbled mess, so songs are impossible to find there. Same as with all other features like light mode or Release Radar that doesn't delete itself every week, Spotify decided to screw what users want and do nothing to improve their experience. I honestly don't know a single app that would hate it's userbase more than Spotify does.",negative
Amazing app some few kinks to work out but other than that amazing experience,positive
"I have done all steps your team is suggesting, I cleared all cache and data, I logged out and signed in again,I reinstalled the app. The video clips aren't working anymore and the ""canvas"" option is not existing. Also I can't share my lyrics even though other people with older devices can, and of course the app is updated! Please fix it!!!",negative
I will not delet this app bc of other people find one person offensive music NOT politics i will keep paying for premium Spotify and i will sit here listen to whatever music i can before you all ruin it for me!!,negative
"Spotify is great than Gaana. But one problem, i cant download songs, please fix this with a new update. Thats why i rated 4 stars.",negative
Spotify seems like a great app but if I end up making a playlist it literally doesn't play any songs from my playlist and just adds random songs and if you use all of your skips you're now just forced to listen to it and that's what's wrong with Spotify.,negative
Spotify is such a good app if you love music and you don't want to spend a lot of internet. It's very good and I love it! Keep up the great work!!â­â­â­â­â­,positive
I like that there is a download option and you can stream either just the audio or w/ video,negative
Love it,positive
After the free trial it doesent even let you chose what you want to listen to,negative
Please bring back the notif button for offline mode. Huhuhu. i'll give you 5 stars if you do that ðŸ˜Š,positive
I can listen to everything kind of music at anytime,positive
This app is my main source for music and podcasts and anything audio that I need. It is better than Amazon music. I'm really considering giving Chinese New Year gifts of Spotify premium trials or month subscriptions to my closest family and my 2 best friends. I did the free trial and realized how much my life has been enriched by having excellent access to all of my audio entertainment all in one place. Developing an algorithm that reaches underground artist in mixed genres would be a godsend.,positive
best music app i have ever used. this app truly deserves 5 stars. but... one problem. Some songs are not playable. i dont know why. And how to download songs to play it offline. But overall and without including these two problems the app is perfect. keep this up!!,positive
Easy to use and provides great suggestions!,positive
"It's been going for months now, why does this app always change the settings of my storage from external SD card to phone storage. The downloaded songs are eating up my phone storage space, while I have an so much free space on my external SD card. And it takes a long time to transfer the downloaded songs back to external SD from phone storage, it's faster to uninstall the app and download the tunes again. Please fix.",negative
"Spotify was working great until the last update which was yesterday. Ever since that update the app takes so long to load, makes me want to uninstall the app. The app takes forever to load and whenever it does load it doesn't want to play my songs. To fix it, I have to go out of the app and then open it again. That doesn't even work sometimes. I know this comes up a lot under the review section but adds after every song, seriously guys? It's just annoying, that's all.",negative
"Simple, quality, clear sound Easy access to many jonneras of music at your fingertips",positive
"The app always plays songs that aren't on my playlist, I tried removing the songs from my playlist but I can't find them. They're not in the recommendation either, please fix this.",negative
"To separate it from other apps, please develop inbuilt DJ tool like, while we are making own music queues/ playlist, there is possibility to also add different dj themes to play the songs track. This would definitely improve user experience",positive
Amazing music app,positive
I love it I can download all my favorites wit great sound from the oldest to the latest ðŸ˜,positive
Trash podcast player. Crashed constantly mid podcast and have to close app and restart to try and finish listening. Garbage plain and simple.,negative
New update is terrible. You can only search for artists you follow. Why can you no longer search for artists that you have liked their songs?,negative

I like Spotify I believe to be the best platform for music but the adds are why to long but this is better than anything else,positive
"Latest update automatically plays music upon opening the app when connected to a Bluetooth device??? EXTREMELY annoying, PLEASE allow an option to disable :(",negative
Best music player ever in Android play store.. This is very smooth in handing and not issues..highly satisfied with Spotify... I will rate 100 out of 100ðŸ˜ðŸ˜â¤â¤ Very happy with this music ðŸŽ¶app. Thanks Spotify.,positive

Very good and very nice and I'm very pleased with the app Spotify,positive
Having Spotify premium gives me a feeling of iPhone owners. They always feel superior over Android. Spotify is superior over all the other music apps.,positive
Best experience ,positive
"Best app ever! I just gave it -1 because sometimes it dosent have the songs I'm looking for when I search it up for example ( Still with you - jungkook))) but yeah, after all it's a wonderfully app! And the adds are not even that bad to! Good app I recommend it!",positive

It is great to pop in my ear buds to listen to music or podcast while doing my janitorial duties,positive
Very nice app still need some improvement...but it's great all round,positive
"Usually works great, but recently it keeps bugging out (I.e. the music will just stop and other times the music plays but Spotify doesn't display or seem to know anything is playing). I'm guessing a new update has a few bugs? If you could please sort out the issue that would be great!",negative
So I am a Non-premium user. I opened app and played a song. It started playing ad. Usually I kill the app and reopen it and the song starts directly. But this time I was patient and understanding and I waited for the ad to complete. But it went on playing 4 ads of 30 seconds each. That moment I closed it and went to youtube. Songs are all about mood. I understand why ads are important but you guys are straight away killing the mood. No other platform has such terrible ads-play management.,negative
"In support of its stance against cancel culture, I switched my music subscription to Spotify from Amazon music.",negative

"It was a very good app, it's still good ; has a lot of songs,we can make our own playlists, everything is good but recently whenever I go to Spotify,play a song and let the music play in the background the app just crashes every single time.I'm not able to listen to music without the app open it's just so sad.Spotify used to be my comfort app but not anymore unless this problem is fixed. I'll surely change my rating to 5 stars if this problem gets fixed!.",negative
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! Serious issues with playback. The progress bar disappears every few songs. The app must be stopped and restarted to get the progress bar to function as normal. This bug also breaks being able to control playback through connected devices. Until this issue is corrected, Spotify is not worth the download let alone worth paying for their ""service"". Pass on this app and save yourself time and money.",negative
"Absolutely amazing app, can't complain.",positive
I love it sooo much it has a lot of songs but they could add more kpop,positive
Wow,positive
It's wonderful ðŸ‘ for me thank you Spotify.,positive
Lovely place to listen to all different artists and genres of music Update thanks for fixing it ,positive
"The app itself seems to be very unstable, but the spotify support team has been amazing in trying to help me get my playlists back. I'm giving one star because I'm rating the app, the support team is definitely 5 stars all the way!",positive
"I like how it has most songs free, but it adds like 15+ songs I've never heard to my Playlist and I only have 6 skips.",positive
It will not work half the time and when i try it my phone stop working. It use to work but now it dosent,negative
It deserves a 0 for being anti free speech. It only allows communist Democrat podcasts pushing constant propaganda. It has become pathetic.,negative
A whole amazing world of music and blogs has just opened up for me. It's awesome,positive
On mobile this app is rather annoying. When I try to listen to a specific song it plays me a playlist where I need to wait 30mins-1hour to hear the song I want. On my laptop I have no problem and love this app,positive
Phone app really needs a multiple choice option where we can choose multiple songs and add to a playlist.,negative
"I never used Spotify, but I got premium now just to support free speech and cancel cancel culture. As a vaccinated person who encourages it, I stand with Rogen.",negative

Everything is good in this app songs to quality everything,positive
Quality of song is not too good,negative

Tha best ,positive
Been using this app for a while and have had no issues. As of the last week I can't listen to my favorite podcast (DrinkinBros). I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times and no luck. What's up Spotify?!,negative
The music stops as soon as the phone locks and doesn't always show songs when they're playing...it's quite annoying,negative
It's good but I hate how you can't listen to one singular song and the only option is shuffle and they add to your Playlist and I hate that I only want to listen to the songs that I want and you can't do anything but listen this app is bs and you need premium to do everything,negative
The best music platform available!,positive
You can remember the songs from the lyrics that are written. Such a great app of songs.,positive
This is the best app to listen to music and release you stress â¤ðŸ§¡ðŸ’›ðŸ’š I would use this app 24/7ðŸ’¯,positive
I like the app but it doesn't really search for the actual music I want and I can't choose where I want to play the music,negative
"Great to stream just what I want, whenever I want",positive
It's the best way to discover new tunes.,positive
Good music for everyone and tastes,positive
"Spotify is the BEST MUSIC APP on the Market! It's available free{w/very limited commercials} or $9.99ðŸ˜ monthly.

PLUS, throughout the year Spotify is constantly making FREE PLAYLISTS for you! {Your Favorite Artist, End of Year Music, Dance Compilation Music etc.} You're the 1st to get NEW MUSIC from NEW ARTIST! They're simply the BEST!",positive
I love this app but I cant skip songs  so many ads 23 songs you play,positive
"Decent for music when you get to actually listen. I should not have to have 9 adds after only one song just because I don't have premium. This used to be my favorite app for any music, now I barely listen anymore and for a music lover, it's heartbreaking.",positive
Buggy. Playing a song or playlist doesn't show the controls or which song is playing until I close and reopen the app.,negative
"Terrible app. The podcast section is horrible, I don't know why they changed it, still no auto downloads. No longer use for podcasts. I am so sick of hearing the same music in my daily mixes, it's so hard to find some new music lately. The app has become slow and unreliable, especially when offline. Where has the player gone? I am playing a song in the app, I have no controls, can't see what's playing, like it, nor see lyrics! Hate this app.",negative
Very poor for a paid service. -The music frequently stops for a few seconds -Play/pause and skip button disappears -The shuffle function favours like 20 songs I will be contacting spotify for atleast a partial refund.,negative
Not work in my mobile properly just useless,negative
Adds,positive
First time downloading this app. Easy to use. Recommend highly.,positive
Spotify is the best music podcast appðŸ’¯ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘Œ,positive
Nothing to complain its simple and I love it,positive
Experience is alright given there is no access to podcast in my region,positive
"Charges 10 fold for trial - $10 instead of $3/3 months being regular price; gets snagged after about an hour & won't play, & subtitles will not display on TV screen. Ah, now it's quitting after 10 min - via Cast. Yt, Netflix, Prime, Pandora, none have same issue",negative
Sure would be nice to have a changelog for updates so we know what changes.,negative
I really love this app I literally use it everyday and have a subscription however. For some reason it stops playing all the time it will be playing fine for 20 mins then all the sudden it stops playing and when I try to press play it won't so I have to close the app completely and go back just to turn it back on.,negative
Great platform that I've been using for years. I can get almost everything that I'm looking. All my music anywhere I go. Radio based on ... great for discovering more new music.,positive
"My fav app, I use it the most out of my all apps :) It's not perfect - no, I would have few recommendations how to make it better - but out of all music apps - it is the most accurate :)",positive
"Just the best way to stream music, I use other apps to find music I love listern then open & save it in spotify brilliant.",positive
So easy so navigate.,positive
"Awful app i prescribe the users not to Install it, it is full of ads. You can download other apps like resso it is somewhat better than this. So please don't Download it is the waste of your data.",negative
Listening to music might help your song selected.,positive
"Spotify is my favorite app for music. I don't use other platforms, and this is coming from someone without premium. Even with the ads it's still a good way to listen to music. Making playlists is pretty easy and you can add entire albums or other playlists all at once. If you want to get premium, there's regular times where you can get several months of free premium when you subscribe. Sadly you need premium to listen to individual songs, but it's not too bad. I think Spotify is worth getting.",positive
All the songs are here come download it,positive
Can't turn shuffle off easily in tablet. Can you fix this please? UI shouldn't be this difficult,negative
"Spotify is an excelent product, many sincere and heartfelt thanks and thumbs up for Spotify. Welldone.",positive
It worked and now it doesn't at all I pay spotify premium just for it not to work,negative
Spotify is the best music streaming app I've ever used wow,positive
"App works fine. Bravo for standing up for free speech in the face of cancel culture. While blue haired karens might scream at you till theyre face matches. Those of us who value the ability to hear everyone greatly appreciate this. Please continue this, i dont pay for any apps, i will get a subscription.",positive
The allow Bluetooth notification keeps popping up on my android phone and it is incredibly annoying.,negative
Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because a lot of times there is sooo much trouble staying connected and it's not my phone it has been that way on numerous devices. And 6 skips in an hour is just not enough sometimes.,negative
Flexibility. Variety. Reliable.,positive
"With the latest update, the positioning of the keys in the song interface has changed and it is different from the positioning we are used to. Difference is nice, but this is not... Old version was much nicer and beautiful and also it was easier to use but now it is really useless both in design and functionality. I hope they get it reinstated as soon as possible.",negative
One of the best music ðŸŽµ in play Store. No one can beat Spotify. Some of the best features are 1. Less Ads 2. Very Smooth UI. 3. Best Recommendations 4. Almost all songs available in Spotify.,positive
"I love this app, the sound is clear and there is good use of song settings including lyrics that dosent need spotify premiem, althogh most things need premiem and there is a TON OF ADS. I reccomend using this app for for clear audio and sound. This app does need wifi. I personlly dont think anythings wrong with the app. But it could be better.",positive
Been using this app since a long time it's horrible on phone you have a limited amount of skips and the ads are annoying I would be less annoyed at the abs if the company wasn't sketchy as hell I wouldn't recommend not downloading the app I just recommend probably bring a computer so you actually skip stuff and if you don't have a computer then have fun with six skips,negative
"Long time premium member. Spotify is part of my daily to and from work. There was a problem before with it shutting down when I was using my phone on other apps, the web etc. It seemed it was fixed and as of this morning seems it's back again. As a premium member I would hope this is addressed quickly so I can give it a better rating.",negative
unless you pay for premium you aren't allowed to choose what you listen to. Spotify is literal garbage.,negative
Loading issues daily...paying for this is going to end for us. Not worth the annoying stress,negative
"To the team of spotify, this is to inform you that I dont have any active subscription and i haven't paid one(not even the tried the trial) but I'm not getting any advertisements in the middle of playlists like the premium users... please check what it is! Thank you!",negative
"Completely disappointed with Spotify. Stupid podcast episodes are cluttering the window, many other easy to fix things are getting in the way, there are lots of votes to fix such issues but Spotify just doesn't care. Moved here from Google music but never thought it would come to same state.",negative
"When I started using this app it was working well but then 1 month in and the app starts making a glitch in were I can't select a song and it says ""This action can not be performed now"" and it is frustrating and if it was a month ago or if they fixed the bug I would've rated it 5 stars but unfortunately this annoying problem popped up.",negative
i dont know if you guys notice it but your app really loads very slow in one ui 4.1 pls fix it,negative
"The app is great, and the recommendation system is also nice. However - can we have a filter by country? We're at war here in Ukraine, and I would very much appreciate if you could cut me off from russian artists that keep squeezing into my ""Recommended""! This issue bothered me from the very beginning, but now it became even more stressing. Thanks!",positive
It's amazing...just don't have the premium yet...but it's still fine,positive
There is no option to download single song. Download is available for full album Only. So add icon to download one by one song.,negative
Why do you keep adding amazing features and then removing them?? I just don't understand.,negative
"After recent update, the Now Playing bar disappears when opening again after using minimizing or using another app. App must be manually force quit and restarted for each use.",negative
"Cool app! But here's a suggestion: Give the users tha ability to make partially-randomized mixes. I like the idea of the wellness mix, but I don't like the content you suggest. I want there to be a way for me to randomize songs and podcasts I like in my wellness mix. Also, I prefer the playlist list in the previous version of the app. I hope you'll add a function to display playlists as an actual list not blocks.",negative
Spotify is good game and I song play the song and play the game is it very very good,positive
"Free sucks! Premium is the way to go! Free spams you, it plays commercials as soon as you turn it on not cool Spotify. The record was five commercials in a row! Premium no commercials and you can actually find the music you were trying to find. Free it's only going to show you the artist minimum amount of songs. (Bones(the rapper) is the best music on here.) Premium upgrades to sound quality.",negative
I really enjoy having no ads and enjoy being able to download all my music. But I keep running into bugs and glitches every single day. It ranges from meet tapping play on something and it's starts playing but it won't let me pause it or even show me what's playing in the hot bar at the bottom. This means I also can't skip through the time line. Fix your app before you get people to pay 15 bucks a month.,negative
"Spotify is a wonderful way to disconnect From the world and connect with a universe filled with emotions, feelings, thoughts and a plethera of sounds all of your own making. Come and enjoy creation of your own with Spotify. Happy Travels. Good Speed.",positive
It sucks for a music app it doesn't allow you to pick the song you want but if it's in your Playlist? It won't play that either. Likes? Not that either. And what if you just skip it? Only 6 skips per hour it's like the person who designed this never listen to music before. The whole apps sh!ty nothing about it works. And the ads the whole free for 30min thing lies.,negative
After the latest update the control bar disappears so im not able to pause or skip songs. It fixes after i close and reopen the app but i love doing that while drivingðŸ™„,positive
I am trying to log in my account since 2 days but I can't log in. I need my account any how. Please solve my problem fast I just want to hear my playlist,positive
"It was fine until that auto shuffle happened, if i try to play from my liked Playlist, it plays songs that I never heard before. It won't let me play other songs without it being in playlist shuffle either. It would be fine if that wasn't added, Let people enjoy listening to the music they like and not have to pay for premium to stop that auto shuffle.",negative
Its very great it's so good to control songs in different devices,positive
This is one of the good app for streaming audio but i have request if u could make the advertisement lesser because it's so annoying to listen 3 ads at a same time. more than songs ads plays it's just so annoying.,negative
Great Collection & Amazing App,positive
Really like this app and I can listen to my songs all day long. There's few music apps that can touch this,positive
"Good app, sorry about the bad review earlier I might have got mad because of my songs weren't playing, they still aren't but its a good app because good recommendations",positive
"Great selection, annoyed that I get Ads on podcasts when I pay for premium service, and issues with the ""now playing"" function not working correctly- example playing joe rogan podcast and its telling me nothing is playing. Updating to see if fixed. Took advantage of the 3 month free trial and happy to continue to pay for premium with the huge selection in music. Rarely ever encounter a song or artist I can't find on here (happened once). Easy to use and make Playlists as well.",negative
There's nothing really to rate if the app crashes everytime I try to play a song. Terrible..,negative
I started using it recently...and I've enjoyed...until recently....I found out I can't play songs separately.......it's frustrating and I don't even.....pls...restore the prev settings pls....,negative

"It's a brilliant app for streaming musics, listening to songs, podcasts and audiobooks, stories etc..",positive
This is the very good ,positive
User Interface sucks. In term of UI/UX it's not even close to other music streaming apps.,negative
"I hate this update, and why did you unabled all my playlist? I can't even listen to whatever music that I wanted, adds keeps popping up, stop focusing on money. This ruined it.",negative
At some point this app itself turned to junk. Playbars dissappear so you can't control what's playing. Shows the wrong media in now playing. Just runs horribly. Hopefully a company this size puts some money into fixing it eventually,negative
Performance of the App is really bad and slow. The playing song bar on the bottom isn't showing up a lot of times. Have to restart way to often.,negative
"Great app, but quality suffering since April 22. Music keeps pausing mid-song. Almost like it is crashing. Whatever update they did caused more problems. Please fix bc I LOVE this app!!",negative
Love everything about it. Listen every day,positive

Also the watch App has no way to fast forward or rewind tracks. The Free App that comes with the Galaxy Watches allows you to fast forward and rewind and skip forward and back in albums and play lists.",negative
Spotify is the best free music podcast hub!,positive
This app needs fixed bad it cuts in and out of songs I'm a premium user it is also not letting me start the song over and when it does it still cuts in and out please fix this soon thank you,negative

"Spotify allows podcasts to ""insert ads"" (full ads outside inserted outside of the episodes like ""songs"") AND the play bar doesn't work anymore. DO NOT PAY FOR PREMIUM",negative
"Spotify is fine except when ur a free listener. It gives u limited skips, adds random songs to your Playlist, gives u ad after ad after ad, and it just ruins the whole app. I will no longer be using spotify",negative
Outstanding on every level....Premium is well worth it,positive
Have only been using it for a month and I have to say it has been a lovely experience,positive
What happened to the shuffle? It only starts on the last song you listened to now? Not really shuffle isn't it?,negative
App hasn't been working the kast few days. I cannot stop pause rewind or fast forward. Anytime I try to pause in the app it doesn't work and I have to restart the app in order to turn the audio off...,negative
"My experience has been poor. App takes forever to load its content, it constantly has a message of no internet connection yet other streaming apps work perfectly. I'm about to cancel my subscription",negative
I love this app but I recommended of you can to get premium so then you can skip and not have to listen to adverts,positive
It's the best out there. BUT... But I've seen that other accounts have this lyrics feature that I don't have on my account. It works on my computer but it doesn't on my phone.,negative
"Am using Spotify premium, and in my new device running on Android 12 and snapdragon 695 shipset, the latest version of this app is crashing repeatedly as I'm playing a song. Please fix it with an update, till now I am using Spotify lite....but please do the needful asap",negative

i enjoy this app when im doing school work,positive
"Not bad. It's free and the music I listen to is here. I feel like they read my mind. Also the talk shows are interesting. If I did have a complaint maybe it would be, they don't carry whole episodes of coast to coast with George Noory.",positive
Excellent. All options are available,positive
Andi,positive
Good,positive
Love,positive
"Edit: as of June 13, 2022, there have been two more updates, and now nothing will download. If this isn't resolved soon, I will cancel my premium account and go to Amazon Music.

I have updated the app on June 7, 2022, and still have these issues.",negative
"Spotify isnt great anymore, I literally can't listen to playlists without a ""few"" songs being added I don't care much for the shuffle thing, but it's a blue moon for me to hear one of the songs I want to.",positive

"Great but they need to make it easier to find an artist's songs, not just the top 6 most popular",negative
Just good music app,positive
"Was really good but a slight change was added and made it worse. The change was that when adding songs to a playlist, you no longer can listen to a 5 second Clip of the song. This makes it incredibly annoying to figure out what song you would like especially when looking for new songs",negative

"Spotify is the worst streaming service I have ever used. I don't think it's functioned correctly on android longer than a week in YEARS at this point. There were plenty of issues before this update, but after it I cannot choose any songs in my playlists AT ALL. It registers the click, and does nothing. Premium user, phone is up to date, app is up to date, unisntalled/reinstalled, cleared cache & data, restarted/reset my phone, reset my wifi. The problem is spotify itself, like always.",negative

"I don't know what is wrong with the app, it was fine till I updated my phone software. It is okay if I listening through my laptop, I think the trouble was not my account but the app itself. I rely on Spotify to listening music. I hope I can still use the app by phone since I use the app most of the time in it.",negative

"A pretty buggy application. I am regretting buying Spotify premium. Often when I switch songs the music changes but the name, art, etc of the song doesn't change and the application hangs. Sometimes when I play a song it isn't visible in the swipe down menu, so I'm unable to pause it or change it. I've tried reinstalling the app, updating it, and restarting my phone. My device is OnePlus 7 BTW. It's very funny how such a big company hasn't even got basic things right.",negative
I love this app... Every feature is soo good!! But it would be even better if we had an option to reorder songs in a self-made playlist... Please turn this out...,negative
"Keeps changing the user interface with songs, car mode sucks. Music keeps cutting out. Downloaded items aren't downloaded when trying access them without service.",negative
Love it with premium but without I don't think you need that many adds. Every 30mins? Unnecessary,negative
I have been using Spotify for a few years now and I'm really enjoying it!,positive
This App is good but not flexible. It should have features like 1. Download 2. Play offline. It's discouraging and painful if one can't play the music he or she likes offline or even download to play later offline.,negative
"This app is good and has all songs. Still I gave it 3 stars as the app is getting annoying day by day, it's ads are increasing making everyone crazy. Song-->Ad-->Song-->Ad",positive
Great but they say ads won't come for 30-90 mins but it comes in 10-15 mins... Overall great app love it,positive
Come on now. Why does it have a couple of minutes to move my downloaded music onto my SD card but then takes close to 6 hours for the app to open? Also theirs tines when my downloads delete and I have to do everything again.,negative
"The best site to set up your Playlist or listen to podcasts. I've been with Spotify for many moons. I've never had an issue with it. Try it, you'll find out if it's for you",positive
Keeps randomly stopping when playing in the background. The media bar doesn't appear when you start a song and you need to kill the app and restart it to make it appear. On Android Auto is seems to sometimes just not play anything and just gets stuck on the retrieving information/media screen.,negative
Spotify is the best app where u can listen ðŸŽ¶ to music,positive
"It won't work while I'm somewhere offline, but other than that it's fine. The songs are high quality and I like how you can listen to it while working.",positive
This app is no doubt is best music app. You are getting more features in free.you can play music in background. Their is a lrisk also. You can group songs. This is best app for music. Very good work Spotify. I just only hope be like thin only.,positive
Love my music and yours,positive
Y'all need to work on how the music is sorted and sorting options. Also the options if I want recommend music and etc. Don't care for podcasts or whatever tracks you think I may like.,negative
"This app is the worst when it comes to listen on bluetooth. Always disconnecting, pausing and restarting what you listen to and the app will just stop working in general.",negative
Es muy muy buena la utilizo todos los das y todo perfecto sin embargo le doy 4 porque ya he visto que hay actualizaciones con una interfaz nueva y todava no se actualiza mi aplicacin pero fuera de eso todo espectacular,positive
"Whatever you've done, I can't connect to speaker, headphones anymore. Can't actually even play thru my phone. Only way I can use this is chroming to telly, which is no good to me at all. Please fix it or I'm chucking, cos no point paying for something I can't use.",negative
"Pretty good app, the sound quality of music is pretty good with the free version. Then it gets even better eith the premium version.",positive
"The app has many options to choose your favorite artists or select genre of your choice. I had no glitches or any problems with it. Overall, I would say spotify is a good app and highly recommend it.",positive
Nice app i love it and its easy to use,positive
"I hate the new update, I can't pause the song or see the lyrics, I wish it didn't update",negative
"Used to be really good, since beginning of February 2022 app and Windows versions both state ""offline please check connection and try again"" I'm always connected to the Internet while using pc and phone via WiFi and still no joy. I've even uninstalled both and as spotify doesn't recognise my WiFi I can't log back in. Please fix.",positive
"Since last update, it has trouble loading podcasts and won't play my music Playlist. Can't use the app at all currently. Please advise.",negative
Very good quality old school music I love Spotify,positive
"This app provides a lot but the constant playback issues and glitches have only gotten worse. Randomly disconnects from bluetooth, stops randomly during playback, half the time the bar in the notification tray does nothing. It seems spotify doesn't care if it's app is functional. If this continues I'm cancelling my prime. I don't need to pay for broken garbage, I can get that for free.",negative
I have an android so I used YouTube music but when I found out Spotify doesn't require money I rushed to sign in unlike YouTube music when I turn on off my phone it still works,positive
"I enjoy creating playlists and finding out about the things that are on other people's playlists. I especially appreciate the suggestions by Spotify based on the atmosphere/time of day/rutine and not just the music style. I love the fact that all the podcasts I listen to can be found here in one place. I also plan to contribute by uploading content, hopefully starting in a few days.",positive
Terrible app. If you are not constantly using data the app functions like garbage. It's constantly removing downloaded music so when I go to listen off grid it's just not there. Definitely not going to pay for this anymore. Spotify needs to step it up.,negative
Can't even play songs anymore. Searching songs will only give you relates songs but not the one you searched for. This app used to be good...,negative
Now playing bar missing regularly since last update and music stopping randomly. The time taken so far to identify and implement a fix has been too long.,negative
Amazing none stop music,positive
"The only reason i have spotify is for the joe rogan experience and its almost not worth it the app co stantly crashes, changes what im listening to the way it works is trash i have to uninstall and re install this stupid app at least twice a month i ho estly cant believe people pay for this trash",negative
Music quality and algorithm is top notch. But one big issue is the i can't add a song to my queue by searching . The whole menu list is gone ! Whats wrong with you? This is the so far best music streaming service But this one thing is resisting me now from Taking premium!,negative
I love Spotify I can find all the music I like and make different lists I can connect it to my Alexa and ask her to play my list on Spotify it's great,positive
It rarely shows what song I'm playing. Stops randomly and still plays at times adds even though Im been paying for premium.,negative
Upgraded my phone to a s22 plus and now the option of seeing the songs that I have liked by a specific artist is gone. Now I have to search through the artists entire library to find what I want,negative
"Jumps 6 songs at a time, then plays for 5 seconds and promptly cuts to ads and never returns to the playlist.. try to Google a fix, but no solution reference in Google.",negative
"I love the way you put different Playlist s together for me,I know that I'm going to always have good music to listen to, Thanks for the great music.",positive
"I love this app, personally I have the premium duo I share with a family member, but once ads are out of the way, this is the best music app to listen to your favorite songs on!",positive
Not working on Samsung S21 Ultra,negative
"The app continuously stops working. Every time I open it and start using it, the app just doesn't support changing songs or turning up the volume. It is very annoying and immediately gets you out. Suddenly you are not listening to music anymore, and your entire phone just freezes.",negative
"Spotify is largely glitch-free for me but probably once a month refuses to connect to my car stereo via Bluetooth. No matter how many times I restart both, reconnect, pair, etc., Sometimes it just decides not to work together.",negative
"Why does the app just randomly start playing, this gets annoying. Please make a change in the android app to have an option to turn off autoplay.",negative
Spotify contains a variety of podcasts with great content the programs provide entertainment and information. There is consistently something new and interesting to listen to.,positive
"I use to love this app. To me, it use to be one of the best music apps. But after last update, it has gone down hill. Now when I listen to a playlist it will just start playing random music and then start the playlist over again. I use to never have any problems. Now it is full of bugs. Until it gets fixed, I won't be using it anymore. Until it is fixed, I wouldn't recommend it to others either.",negative
The app is sooo amazing you can listen to music while your phone is off or play a game and listen to music download this app,positive
"The app on my chromebook is super glitchy. If I let it play at the end of a podcast episode, it almost always skips ahead two episodes instead of going to the next one. Sometimes it skips to the next episode after an ad in the middle of the current one. And can we NOT have to listen to an ad again just because we back up the episode a little right after the ad finishes? That's really aggravating. It also freezes a lot. Youtube does that right.",negative
So many adds are playing... While iam listening the songs suddenly play the un skipped adds... Every online music app play the skipped adds but this music app is playing un skipped adds.. the avarage time of add is 30s..,negative
Hi Spotify. The app is awesome but from the last 1 month I am not able to find any lyrics for any song. Hope that the team will rectify the problem soon. Thank you.,positive
"This app really sucks! I don't know what happened but last week, I've been getting these bugs like my liked songs are only playing in 10 seconds and when you exit from the app, it will stop. Also, I can't play my normal playlists without playing it in the shuffle button. This frustrates me.",negative
Iam giving a big star,positive
"Easy to use and best of all, they support Joe Rogan which is why I bought the premium package",positive
"Nice useful app, however sometimes not user friendly like when it gets stuck showing a previous song or podcast and doesn't show the actual songs playing. A bit annoying.",negative
You can easily reach the type of playlist you want but there is some ad issue. Otherwise it is best app,positive
"I rlly love spotify but recently the ads are getting excessive, I was supposed to get ""30 minutes of ad free listening"" and got 3 ads after 1 song?? non premium users deserve more </3",negative
Good until you plays the song I didn't like. Can't even switch to other song.,positive
"Can be glitchy. Suddenly stopping, not loading, and not displaying controls.",negative
Was about to cancel subscription to other music streaming apps and start exclusively steaming and subscribing through Spotify. Until the recent support of the cancel culture. I would like to choose to hear ALL sides and make informed decisions. Hopefully Spotify stops censoring nonviolent content.,negative
"When I play my downloaded songs, there are times when it stops out of nowhere...and it's not that my speaker needs charging.",negative
"Hey can I get 9 commercials in a row in the middle of my workout? Yes that absolutely happened. 1 is enough every few songs, and until that becomes the standard you will get 1 star from me.",positive
Worst update not working with Google assistant yesterday it was working but now it's not working after reinstalling of Spotify,negative
Amazing periodt,positive
"I would give much better due too the song I like in there but only had a small window to listen to stuff the I couldn't so that's a problem in my case, but my guess would be it's for the money, all I'm saying is it ruined my experience with Spotify",negative
Rubbish update app its messed up at songs on my play list no longer the same as I has. It won't play anything I click on anymore it plays what it likes even if when using a play list.,negative
"a really great music app, but i occasionally get logged out and can't log back in with it saying that the app is in offline mode",positive
Nice app all music,positive
"Excellent quality. Great selection of music and podcasts. Although, I have premium but still get adds on podcasts which is a bit annoying but otherwise really enjoy!",positive
Nice working,positive
"One of the best music apps I've used, virtually any song you could imagine is here and hardly any adds, I don't pay for the app but I feel like I get paid users benefits. I tell people all the time to switch to Spotify y'all are great keep up the good work",positive
Good x love Spotify and the music variety best thing during lockdown x.,positive
"Great app, would never use anything else for listening to music from... although prime is a wee bit pricey",positive
Love the app but only problem is that I'm a student and idk if I wanna spend on an app rn. Otherwise 30mins and like 1 min ad is pretty good for a free song player cuz YouTube has HAS soooo many Ads. Solid 9/10.,positive
"Incredible, the weekly new fines based on the genre of music you're the same too. Always finding new music that I enjoy.",positive
Back ground activity is bad for mobile battery,negative
I love the Spotify platform. I get to choose what truths I believe in no matter what podcast I'm listening to.,positive
Wonderful app been using it for years like everyone else I've been experiencing issues with glitches and songs stopping and restarting can you please fix this issue,positive
"App is very fantastic but they have so many ads ... I liked a song and then I heard it for a few days but never heard it again . they said ""You discovered a premium future"" I want play again please solve this..",positive
As some songs are not available at it so m giving it 4 stars and hope u gonna fix it asap.. â‰¥ï¹â‰¤,positive
"App has been playing up the last week, songs cutting out all the time, wont play downloaded tracks sometimes",positive
Constantly has player issues where it'll randomly stop playing and you need to reinstall to fix it. Just use the browser version instead.,negative
"I have to download the songs on PC, and save the cache at specific location. And when I try to restore the songs with same cache after reinstalling the OS, the cache doesn't work. Again I have to download the all the songs. It's the waste of my time, money and data, after paying all that money to spotify.",negative
"Latest update does not show what's now playing, not in the app or in notification pull down.",negative
"Nice and thoughtful, I'd however prefer if it didn't mix secular music into gospel tracks, when customizing a playlist.",positive
Best music app i have ever used,positive
Excellent app for listening and creating play lists. Too bad they (Spotify) screw the artists over by paying them next to nothing for their music and hard work. Corporations; money over ethics.,negative
It's really goodalthough it needs ti ad a feature where u can listen to music but u still get ads and u can't download songs. Other than that I really love using the app so 5/5 from me â¤,negative
"I love the variety of artists and music and everything, but I've found that they repeat songs even though the songs on that playlist have not been exhausted. For one artist tonight, within two hours they played the same song 4 times. I could think of at least 2 songs from that artist that were not played at all.",positive
It's excellent app n I am enjoy has a music lover by getting all information,positive
I will be deleting this app and downloading pandora. Spotify plays the same song about every 2 hours today It has been about every hour. Makes for a great day at work so dont waste your time with this junk app. I've given them the benefit of the doubt for too long and nothing changes.,negative
Ads are very annoying,negative
This app need to be fixed. It doesn't let me to select my choice of songs And it plays another song When I want to play something I like.,negative
"Good experience, I downloaded just for the Joe Rogan podcast, all I've ever used before was Pandora, and this app seems to be alot easier and better to manuever thru, and maintain your channels, and you pick up where it left off, I hated on Pandora when something would happen and I'd have to restart something or another, then I miss the song that was just on.. you gotta just wait it out to hear it come on again. There rotation was small so it wasn't long lol",negative
This music app is so much fun but by a month my song doesn't play,negative
Update: Spotify is glitching something crazy! It'll be in the middle of playing a song and then just stop playing. Then sometimes you'll be in the middle of playing a song and then the bar will disappear and you won't be able to stop the song you'll have to close the entire app.ðŸ™„ðŸ™„,negative
I like this if it will work in offline,positive
"Spotify has become smoother since my last review, so I have to clear the app out of history a lot less. I'm not a big fan of the new plus button in the bottom right corner. I don't need to make a new playlist so often that a dedicated spot in the menu is necessary and I don't make podcasts at all. This button is functionally pointless for me and moved the other buttons that I used slightly to the left. Overall, still a great app. I'm just nitpicking the constant changes to the UI.",negative
"Very good app!! I just wish they added a little player on facebook, so that when someone visits our profile they can hear what we're listening to at that specific moment.",positive
Yha humari zindagi m gum h aur tum add chala rhe ho  Plzz try to understand our feelings,positive
This is a very nice app and i highly recommend spotify,positive
I love it enjoy by this message Spotify using mind control,positive
"Well, I've been using the Amazon Music app that is about ten dollars a month. Spotify is way more up my alley. Lots easier to populate your lists. Helpful suggestions. High bit rate sounds great! The thing is, I'm listening to classical music.",positive
Internet connection often gets lost when i have full connectivity on other apps. Songs often fail to play. The home screen rarely updates. It takes ages to load albums that i have downloaded and saved locally. I pay $15 a month for all this disappointment along with a very comprehensive music library which is still rad when it chooses to work.,negative
"The music offline isnt working, i cant play anything even if its downloaded, that and the app has changed so much and for worse",negative
The app loses your spot when listening to podcasts. They are not willing to cancel a crazy person's podcast (joe rogan) who has gone crazy since covid hit. I will stand with Neil Young,negative
"Subscribed to premium by paying 129 on Google Pay but its not upgraded to premium membership, don't have support sections also. Let me know where to raise the complaint",negative
Ilovesptify. Music So keep up the good by work,positive
"App works fine, but a recent-ish update makes the experience of using it frustrating. I use Spotify to not only listen to songs I know, but also to find new songs. There used to be the feature of previewing a song before adding it to your playlist, but it's not there anymore. Makes me use the app significantly less.",negative
Please turn off the bluetooth headphone requirements. We shouldn't have to solely rely on Spotify's casting software to be able to listen to music via just the watch speaker. Every time i pause on the watch i have to play it from the phone again or the watch app wants me to connect a pair of headphones.,negative
Spotify has zero accountability to its clientele in allowing dangerous information to be set forth as facts. I'll be canceling my subscription.,negative
THE NEW UPDATE IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. FIRST YOU CAN'T EVEN PLAY YOUR SONG BECAUSE IT GOES STRAIGHT TO PLAYLIST AND IT PLAYS OTHER SONGS I DONT EVEN LIKE ND WONT PLAY YOUR SONG AND YOU CAN ONLY USE 6 SKIPS PER HOUR ITS ABSOLUTELY BAD. THERES ALSO ADVERTISEMENTS EVERY SECOND I DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO SPOTIFY ANYMORE. LIKE AT THIS POINT I'D RATHER PLAY ON YOUTUBE. I RECOMMEND THE OLD SPOTIFY TBH THIS NEW UPDATE IS JUST SO STRICT AND HORRIBLE!. A WORD TO SPOTIFY. SPOTIFY PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!!!!!,negative
Best music app ever ,positive
"The app is awful, and it keeps getting worse honestly. I even find my friends using iOS complaining about it. Spotify, please put more effort into your app. Until then, I'm switching to anghami.",negative
"Cant watch video, can't skip, cant use settings, suck ðŸ‘",negative
"Please add more songs,more old malayalam and tamil songs as well as album songs",positive
"Everyone around us is safer when a responsible gun owner is carryingâ€¦ And TODAY, the Supreme Court of the United States AFFIRMED this fact in their landmark decision in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v.

Everyone around us is safer when a responsible gun owner is carryingâ€¦ And TODAY, the Supreme Court of the United States AF",positive
Love the selections do many to choose!!,positive
Great podcast selections.,positive
The app just keeps getting better. I love that I can download songs and they continue to strive to attain the rights to all my favorite songs. They even have Decode by Paramore now!! My favorite thing lately is being able to sing along as I read the lyrics in the app!,positive
"Horrible,,i just downloaded the 3 months free and it's just adds,you can't literally hear a song cause there are two or three adds in between",negative
"The notification system seems to be broken after the new update. I don't see it if i play songs if the app was in the background but was not playing music. And if I'm playing songs and pause it, i am unable to dismiss the player notification by swiping. I need to close the app for it to get dismissed",negative
Best music app but your ads are getting more entertaining..i don't have premium cause i enjoy your ads ðŸ¤£,positive
I've been using this app since 2015 and I've loved it. Of course it has had it's fair share of bugs throughout the years but I can honestly say that it's the best one of all.,positive
"Good. Can do better, especially mobile play lists.",negative
Been using Spotify for about a decade now,negative
Recent updates have made this app really buggy. From the play bar disappearing to the search just not returning anything. It sucks.,negative
"I don't know what the hell is wrong with you ppl but I downloaded this on my phone, never got to listen to a song I wanted to listen to, I tried to make a playlist with that one song, played a different one, you are so stupid, I swear",negative
"I really LOOOVVVEEED IT, it heals my soul n mind. Bus ads bich me aa jaate, ab ads toh aayenge hi agar premium nahi lena hai tohðŸ˜… ok bye.",negative
Really good app,positive
The main problem for me it's the absence of Belarusian language. It would be great to use the app in my lang,negative
Overall great. Managing podcasts could use some work. Would love an auto download feature and you can't sort your episodes by oldest episodes first. I also get frequent infinite loading loops on fast wifi.,negative
Keep up the awesome work! ðŸ˜âœŒï¸ðŸ’š,positive
A good application with many songs and reliable AIs ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,positive
The best music streaming site there is!,positive
The sound is good and optional,positive
It a good place to listen to music and watch podcast.,positive
My music is downloaded; so why does it always have to load it. I literally have to turn my phone on airplane mode to get things to load sometimes,negative
"The autoplay setting is completely broken--it will always keep playing different music, regardless of what your app setting choice is. Very annoying!",negative
"For the free spotify, theres lack of abilities. I mean at least when we make playlist play the songs thats are IN the playlist and not suggested.",negative
Anyone know how to download music on newest version?,negative
i enjoy the music here.thank you spotify for the free music!!!,positive
Whenever I make a Playlist it let's me put in my music but when I listen to it it plays a whole different song! Please fix this it's making so mad.,negative
I love it because you can listen to your favourite songs on it,positive
This is very good ,positive
Very bed exercise.no any song play without add useless app,negative
"Like others, came here because of the recent bugs. Anytime I'm playing on Bluetooth, which is the main way I listen, the now playing disappears and I have no way of interacting with the playlist (Can't pause, skip or see what's playing). I need to force close the app and reopen it.",negative
"The podcast section is horrific. Constantly starts podcast entirely over with no warning, skipping the ads experiences terrible as it will go back to the previous clips. Unbelievable to me that an audio streaming app has such a bad audio streaming experience. Makes it almost unusable to listen to long-form podcasts.",negative
Excellent,positive
I lost my music control button on recent updates. ðŸ˜ª,negative
Every song is available on Spotify.. this app is amazing ðŸ¤©ðŸ¥‚,positive
One of the best. App for music no one beat SPOTIFY,positive
"Update: the mobile app has been very buggy lately; sporadically won't show the current song/podcast episode to pause, etc. And lately has been closing the app instead of minimizing when switching between apps. Original: Best music app out of the several I have used over the years. User-friendly interface, excellent organization capabilities, and on-point suggestions for my varied tastes. Easy to find music in English and Spanish; almost never disappointed with search results.",positive
When i share it in snapchat the thumbnail appears twice and the link appears only once with the image i can't delete that so please fix this problem asap,negative
"Well it's a amazing app for streaming music but I feel that there are a bit too much ads. I understand they never the money but I have once gotten 6 ads in a row and they said I would get 30 minutes of ad free music but then around 10 minutes later I a ad. But if you ignore that, it's a great app.",positive
Just the best music app but the ads are pretty frequent well thats expected I think we are using this app for free,positive
Thise are a very usefull app and it get u all the songs ure looking for from old-school to new generation stuff,positive
"Why are Singles and ep's shown as albums under Your Library Also, it would be nice if we could see liked song in albums, like it is with playlists",positive
"It is the best music app . We can listen to any music of any language. Various songs , artists.",positive
I've used this app for about a month now and I'm 99% happy with it. Every now and then there are little glitches but they are easily fixed. Much better than Amazon music!,positive
Good app all musics are available but the add is so long,negative
"Spotify was the best thing that happen to life. Work and studying are so much easier with spotify, and I have music for every mood Im in, even if Im not awake, and if I need something to fall asleep too, I only hape to press one button.",negative
I love Spotify. I have been using it since 2012 and it's still the best music streaming app available. The free version is amazing and isn't junked up with a ton of ads. I usually pay for the premium service but money is tight right now so I was expecting to be disappointed but I am thrilled. Ty for being awesome!!ðŸ’•ðŸ’•â­â­â­â­â­,positive
"Wish I could rate this junk lower. Garbage app, pauses, fails to load sometimes, full of ads, freezes, limited revenue for artists, trashy interface etc.",negative
This was definitely made by a passionate music fanatic team because the algorithm is insane if I just select a track I love and I leave it to Spotify to play the next track haaaa fam I'll just be clicking the green hearts and getting off my seat! But don't slack team Spotify keep at it,positive
Was great until all of a sudden I have to keep force stopping g it because there is no play bar for pausing or forwarding. Very unhappy as I pay for the app and will not continue to do so if it doesn't work properly...very irritating.,negative
It's alright I like YouTube Music but this is offered through my alarm clock. And I started listening to podcasts so it's really nice,positive
"I switched from Amazon music to Spotify and can't say enough great things about it. It has all the music and podcasts that I want, it paid easily with my car and headphones. Amazing.",positive
Love that I can make a playlist of my favorite songs and play them while on Facebook. Plus get reminders of the artist new releases on spotify.,positive
Spotify is where it's at. I love I can play anything.,positive
Continuously interrupt by advertisements by each n every song... Forcefully asking to subscribe,negative
"uh, hello. i really love your app but i havent got my spotify wrapped yet? it should've been on my account. i listened to many artists, have a lot of genres so please put spotify wrapped on my account.",negative
But in Android there are some glitches and bugs while opening some times all works well except search and shows that no song matches,negative
"Very nice and trendy soundtracks and playlists in this specialised app.Keep up with the current system,however,do add in more skips for the normal spotify account and make the premium account public for all to use and enjoy. However, dont install this because when u play a playlist it will get stuck on it and u cannot fix it.",negative
"A bit buggy on mobile (Android 12 One UI 4.1), sometimes controller doesn't show what's actually playing, in app player may not show although a song is playing. These are quite big bugs, but I still give 4 stars. Patch it and you'll get 5 from me :).",negative
Although some of us need to know how to update Spotify in our countries,negative
New update has caused app to freeze alot. I pay for premium but have to listen to adds on most podcasts i listen to,negative
Good and have everything you looking for,positive
Buggy for a week. Stops randomly.,negative
Everything is great... no doubt...but Why do uh always show ads after saying no ads for 30 minutes ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’,negative
"Outstanding!!!! I was a college radio DJ in the '80s. I'm able to find a lot of the artists that I used to play... I'm not a huge fan of mainstream music, I like the odd, eclectic and sometimes bizarre titles.",positive
Very good for listen songs and has alot of songs collection in it.,positive
Spotify you are the best,positive
I tried several apps for music so far it's far this is tied with the paid version of YouTube music,negative
Has all my favorite songs and artists,positive
"Used to be great. Has slowly decayed into trash. Now censoring swear words on top of bugs, random starts and stops, extreme number of ads etc..The list goes on. Avoid paid subscription with this one. Scammy.",negative
"Best music streaming app out there, as long as you got the $5/month premium it is the best app you will have on your phone",positive
Love it all my favourite artists and podcasts all in one place ðŸ™Œ,positive
"if you're on mobile and you don't pay,its annoying, they randomly put songs in your Playlist and force you to shuffle the Playlist leaving you with no choice but to listen to random stuff,and if you wanna skip it you can only skip 6 times per limited hours and ontop of that theres a million adds",negative
I love it because they have all my favorite music and I'm starting to love different kind of musicðŸ˜…,positive
App won't show my liked songs. It says that I have 0.,negative
"Longtime Premium subscriber who loves the service for the most part, but the most recent app update is buggy and nearly unusable. Frequently stops playback, and playback controls often vanish, both within the app and in the system playback monitor. This update is a dumpster fire.",negative
Love how every song I like.,positive
All in one... Always want this kind of app. It's totally perfect.,positive
Disappointing. Unable to find songs . Their 'suggestions' are not related to my search AT ALL. I find Spotify complicated & difficult to use....YouTube is by far easier. Relevant content appears IMMEDIATELY in the search bar and it is the PERFECT MATCH for the material i am looking for. Once I have completed this {negative} review I am going to uninstall Spotify :( ðŸ˜ž,negative
"Not big on spotify but it's not too bad. Not as intuitive to navigate through as others and it's probably that, that means it's not my go to music app. My main one I find has all the same music, possibly even more, but is just easier to use.",negative
What happened? The app is so incredibly glitchy. It won't show up on my phone's lock screen anymore ever. Constant restarts to play music. Premium might not be worth all the hassle to play my music and podcasts.,negative
It really uplifts the mood by already made playlist based on previous preferences,positive
Our app is really good so 5 stars,positive
Love Spotify! My only beef is whenever I watch a podcast the screen goes dark and won't come back. Could be my phone idk. Also stops playing all the time!,negative
"After spotify installed, I stopped using YouTube for music ðŸ˜. Please add feature like *requesting song to Add in spotify collection. There are lot of small music artist who produced amazing songs and musics. Example: speaker of the house-your galaxy(feat. GoldAN).",positive
"Awful experience for the first time, I have no clue why does anyone find this service useful, I wasn't able to play a *single* song without spotify shuffling to 30 other random ones that I don't care one bit for. If I wanted to listen to random unskippable songs that I don't care about, I would have turned on my grampa's radio",negative
The fact that those in premium can't download music to their hard drive is a bit unfair. Also at this point spotify should have dolby capability,negative
"normally such a good app but lately the music just stops playing out of nowhere, you play a song and the listening controls don't show up. you can't pause, skip or shuffle and there are not controls from the notification panel either. super annoying.",negative
Too Many Ads (4/5),negative
"Can't go through my day without this, the best thing I have on my phone.",positive
"Buggy and Slow, keeps showing No Internet available. Even when it is connected to internet. Re-login is a nightmare sometimes almost gave me a heart attack thinking I will have to build my liked songs list again. Good song collection and sound quality though.",negative
This is a good app it's wonderful but I think it has a flaw which is that the songs can't be translated a Korean or Chinese song can't be translated to English pls help with that aside from that the app is perfect ^_ðŸ˜Š,negative
I couldn't live without this app! I use Spotify every single day and it works so great! My previous comment was about a small problem I've encountered and it's been fixed very fast. I'd recommend this app to everyone. Buying premium is 100% worth it!,positive
New bug: the now-playing bar keeps disappearing and only comes back after force closing the app in the settings. Songs would play but cannot be paused.,negative
"I like Spotify a lot, but it started adding songs to my Playlist that I dont know, like, or want on my Playlist. I tried hiding all of them but it gave me more of them. U also can't remove them. The reason I found this is b/c I was playing through my Playlist and a song I dont like started playing. I went to look on my phone and it had added a ton of random things. Please don't tell me to undo the enhance, b/c I dont have an enhance button anymore.i had one last night and did not press it.",negative
It was ok until the last couple months. It glitches a lot Keeps stopping on his own Blue tooth controls don't work and sometimes starts when I'm listening to a different app.,negative
"Been using this app since 2019. The app that i will always install and never uninstall because as an audiophile, even if i use the free version, it answered my music needs when it comes to listening to music. I also love the part that aside from a listener you can also be a creator too.",positive
I like this but the new update i dont like it its b'cuz u have to shuffle ur playlist its kinda bit unfair but its ok Its still playing ur playlist,negative
I love this because you can play any songs anytime amd anywhere,positive
"not sure what happened but for 2 days now, my mobile spotify app hasn't been working. it's showing my playlists on the home page, but not in my library. whenever i click on a playlist, it shows zero songs, so i can't play music on my phone at all. fix this please!!!!",negative
"App constantly loses connection, even though I have a data connection and also a wifi connection. The app has turned to garbage and I'll more than likely uninstall and cancel my premium membership. But hey, thanks for the free echo dot",negative
"Love it, plus I find music I have not heard in a very long time.",positive
Its the best Music streaming service out there if you have the premium version but without it it's not the best since you only get 6 skips per hour they add random songs to your Playlist and there are ads every 30 minutes. Overall a 7/10.,negative
"Unuseable in any way on the free version due to ads and no playlist control. Still unuseable for podcasts, even on the paid version, due to glitchy episode lists and choppy, fragmented audio when downloading episodes. Downloaded tracks glitch when going in and out of wifi range or cell service areas, and sometimes for no reason at all. Reinstalling the app temporarily fixes some problems. One star for great selection I guess.",negative
"I find it incredibly stupid on how I can only shuffle my music and not listen to individual albums without shuffle. If I can do this on my computer with the free version, I should be able to do the same on my phone. Otherwise, I'll just listen to the full albums from my phone using YouTube. It's in better quality, too!",negative
"I've never had a problem with spotify until the last update. I can't connect the app to my devices ( tv ,, headphones ,, etc; ) and that's a huge problem for me. either fix it or I'll have to find another service to use",negative
"I've had this app for almost 5 years.. That is the free version and the paid version. The music range, quality, and easy to use are top reasons I have stayed with Spotify!",positive

At first Spotify was working but then it stop for some reason. When I go to my playlist and click on a song it doesn't play the full song it play a quarter of it so please fix that.,negative
Nice can play my fav songs,positive
What's going on with the app.. it keeps pausing with no reason.. also the currently playing option is no where to be found.. need to restart the app every time this happens.,negative
My my what can I say about Spotify I used all my cool apps with these bands,positive
If this app isn't reopened every time after I pause it the songs are glitchy and pause themselves. If I go to the app I can't even see if it is playing a song. No skip and no song shown playing. Fr if it's not one thing it's the next.,negative
"Great app love the podcasts and music selection and suggestions. However, the latest patch I've been getting soft crashes and play bar disappears. Relaunching resolves but it may take more than 1 attempt",negative
"The best app ever, i wish the premium would be cheaper but I just can't live without it",negative
Absolutely garbage. The updates made it crash all the time. Unusable,negative
"The latest release it's causing a bug on my Samsung M31. Everytime I use Spotify and play a song, the ""window"" containing play/pause button (and where I can click to open lyrics) disappear. I've already tried to clear data, cache and even reinstall the app, without success. Sorry if anything looks confuse, still improving my English. Thanks from Brazil. ( I will change the 1-star when this is properly solved )",negative
Why don't your l have the premium mini And why did you're make this app can't listen to a music with out paying,negative
It just a good app in general but there are too many premium restrictions,negative
"I clicked on the $0.99 for three months promotion and was charged full price ($9.99) immediately. I figured this is a simple mistake. And went to troubleshoot through the help page. The help page is like a maze that continues to throw you in circles, or offer the community page for help, which I couldn't access. After about 40 minutes, I gave up, frustrated and feeling like I wasted 40 minutes of my life. I went with Apple music, which is disappointing because I've been using Spotify for a couple months and enjoyed the easy to use app. However Apple Music was free for 3 months and was activated in 5 minutes. I haven't used Apple Music for very long, so unsure of the comparison.",negative
"Dear Spotify, I just started using your app and I don't like the fact that I can't control it at all. I understand that I'll have to subscribe, but trust is built over time . I enjoyed the first few days but I was bombarded with too many restrictions too soon. It was a huge turnoff. I hope you use more subtle and subjective methods. It was great while it lasted ðŸ˜Œ",negative
"Infact this is the best streaming app so far, I love everything about this app. Am just in love with this app. But is it possible to buy songs and albums from Spotify I don't mind paying huge amount of money. I just love this app and everything about them, it so wonderful and a very loving app to have on your cell phones. Love you SPOTIFY.",positive
"I would like a ""dislike"" button so i can tell the app not to place that song in my randomized lists again. Besides that, this is the best music app.",positive
"It has all varieties of songs ,of all genres, of all ages,of all singers from old times to the latest ones.",positive
Connection drops out easily. Cant listen to some music although it appears in my library,negative
Quality of song is extraordinary but this app subscription amount is high,positive
"Spotify please fix your playlists, certain songs has been replaced with an unauthorized song with an identical name, like what? Hope you fix this immediately",negative
ITS VERY BAD LIKE DONT EVEN PAY IT I PAYED SPOTIFY A LOT JUST TO LISTEN TO MUSIC AND NOW THAT I QUIT GIVING IT MONEY IT JUST STOLE IT THERE AINT EVEN OPTIONS WHERE YOU CAN DISABLE THIS LIKE FR SPOTIFY? YOU JUST TOOK MY 149 PHP WITHOUT EVEN ASKING ME i want refund spotify pls reply to this i could spend all that money to buy me some food :( also premium sucks why wont it let me change plans? or cancel them? pls fix this,negative
Why the heck is the music control button aligned to the left?? This is messed up my muscle memory and less convenient for right handed user! Please revert the changes or at least make an option to choose which layout to use in the settings menu.,negative
Great music ,positive
Love it,positive
Lyrics are good but sometimes it's come in hindi writing . I want English writing. But spotify is best .,positive
App usually works great but lately it crashes every few minutes when in the background. since this is a paid service I would hope for a slightly better experience then this but I can't complain too much.,negative
I love this app it's very convenient it has all the music I was never gives me any problems,positive
Lot of old songs needs to be updated. But if radio stations could be played it would have been wonderful,negative
"I tried to delete my account on spotify to make a new one, but it didn't take back the email. So now everytime I try to make a new account it takes me back to the log in screen where I CAN'T even log back in because it says the account is inactive. PLS FIX THIS!!!",negative
After update the lyrics of some songs isn't showing which were available before update,negative
It never lags and there are no ads I love it 5 out of 5,positive
I love playing music on Spotify plus its free!,positive
I've been on Spotify for.... I forgot BUT if your looking for a music app I'd say Spotify the only reason it's a 4 instead of a 5 I because you have to get Spotify premium to take the ads awayðŸ˜—,negative
Bad app if I would be the owner I would rate it a 1 star its really bad you only get 6 skips per hour and the premium price is to big I think you need to fix it so you can skip any song you want even without premium because getting 6 skips per hour is mean and that's why I give it a 1 star,negative
Everyone else can see song text but i can not and i pay for the family account and have one of the nieuws phones some of my friends even the same and it makes me sad,negative
Spotify better than resso,positive
Spotify is a best high quality music source,positive
Keeps crashing and won't play my downloaded episodes without my data being on. Which defeats the purpose,negative
I used to rate 5 everything is good and fine but lyrics is not showing,negative
"Update: The last version behaves wierdly and won't display the ""now playing"" bar and I have no way to control the playback. Please fix! Poco F3@android 12. Original post: Works well as a paid user. Don't forget to increase the quality to highest when you register, in the settings. Needs hi-res quality like the competition for premium users.",negative
I think it's a good way to wake up listening to something instead of a clock going off every morning. And it helps connect with family and friends also helps u get in a good mood or if u wanna sing with someone this is the number one app I recommend.,positive
Nights with lovely songs is awesome,positive
"My goto music app, HQ bitrate needed.",negative
Would like at least two months of continued streaming and need to add video,negative

"My major complaint is the app itself. Prone to random bugs and glitches that make it frustrating to pay for premium when media randomly stops playing or doesn't work, when the shuffle doesn't work, etc. There's a lot of basics the app fails to repair or properly deliver. Please get your team to improve the clunky app, don't want bells and whistles just a functioning program! Thinking of canceling and going to amazon. UPDATE: two years later, still glitchy and barely usable. I will be cancelling",negative
The layout is frustrating. I just want to see the things I want not the things that Spotify wants me to see. I only got the app to see Joe rogan and I get bombarded with a bunch of trash I never wanted to see,negative
Well now the app is has an issue where it'll not show whats playing and won't allow for skipping or pausing. I have premium so I should be able to and the only fix seems to fully shut down the app and restart it which gets annoying after 5 times,negative
"Maybe just working on animations but its still great , Like it â¤ï¸",positive
"Dude what did you all do to your app?! The player at the bottom just vanishes sometimes and I have to close it. Half of my ""favorite artists"" I've never even heard of. When I'm listening to any album from certain genres and it ends, it plays the same songs afterwards every time. Songs I like, but used to a lot more, til they automatically came on all. The. Time. Was 5 stars until the last couple updates.",negative
"I've put off joining Spotify for years, even though Literally everyone I know uses it! Decided today was the day because I want to support companies that respect freedom of speech. Loving it so far. Will be deleting YouTube Music soon. Thanks Spotify for standing up to the mob!",positive
"I recently bought Spotify premium since the frequency of ads were annoying. But turns out, it's waste of my money. The app never opens up everytime I try to launch it, irrespective of the internet connection quality. Big thumbs down ðŸ‘ŽðŸ»",negative
Bring back the like button,positive
I have no problems it gives me the music that I need and the music that I like and the music that I haven't heard in ages Plus I can have my whole family on the monthly plan at an affordable price thank you Spotify keep up the good work,positive
"App is crashing after the update, and it's acting crazy, anytime I'm playing a song it's like crashing down.",negative
Cancelled premium when I read about the lack of pay to artists and the profits funding tech weapons. I dont want money I spend on listening to good vibes out there funding wars. But I can't with all these ads thoooo,negative
Spotify is also a good application when there is internet and not good when it is offline,positive
It was great but now on this new phone the app doesn't pop-up on the lock screen or the notification panel it doesn't show a preview of the current song,negative
"I love this app, but they could make it a little cheaper.",positive
"I cant pay with my MasterCard, I have used two different cards now. Spotify please help",negative
The app is good actually. The only problem is the ads are too much. I hope you look into this matter. Not everyone can or wants to get the premium pack. Thank you,negative
Only Spotify comfort's me,positive
I love Spotify the only problem is that the ads come up ever 3 songs or 2 and it just gets annoying but other wise it really easy to use and you have to have ads so I don't blame them so if you were to ask me if you should get Spotify or a different music app I would say Spotify all the way,negative
Good service,positive
I enjoy Spotify very much indeed.,positive
I can't choose the songs I want to listen to,negative
Best music app ever. Really enjoy and like it,positive
It's good when u want to listen to music,positive
This is a really good app I use it ever day and recommend new songs that now days I listen to everyday,positive
"I was loving the premium experience until it ran out and your money-hungriness came out. Not a single heads-up that my premium subscription was running out. You guys have a million different notifications for new releases, podcast updates, and useless promotional content, but no reminders for subscription renewal. All of a sudden, I was completely locked out, had to listen to 2 nonsense ads back-to-back, and all my downloads were deleted. Very bad, team.",negative
"It's excellent ,less data consumer",positive
"Paying for premium still results in adds/commercials when listening to podcasts. Additionally, Joe Rogan uses racist terms (new video showing it) and my wife and kids are black - not cool with that. I appreciated the different viewpoints and multitude of topics he brought to his show, but I can't support a company or individual who is blatantly racist or uses racist terminology. I ended my subscription and deleted the app until this mess is resolved. Lots of issues at Spotify over this guy.",negative
The new update sucks!!! Songs randomly stop for no reason. FIX THIS!!!!,negative
Good music app i like it very much.,positive
"The remote feature may work on other phones, but it doesn't work on the stupid Pixel 6!",negative
"Great app! Whether its tracking down nearly forgotten songs, seeing what favorite artists are up to, or finding great songs and artists I didn't know! Of course its also awesome at play lists for your fave artists and genres.",positive
When I updated the app it wont let me pick the songs that I want to listen to and I only get 6 skips an hour. So I uninstalled it and redownloaded it and the same thing happend,negative
Have had to cancel due to all the problems mentioned in other reviews. Such a pity as when it works its a great subscription but unfortunately it hasnt worked properly for the last few mths. Constantly having to restart my phone to get it to work and even then it only worked for a short time. I have tried everything suggested by Spotify and nothing was resolved and after seeing other reviews it's clearly not an isolated issue. Off to try amazon music.,negative
"Audio constantly stops randomly after a few seconds. None of the suggested troubleshooting options work, shoddy app, definitely switching back to Pandora",negative
Nothing to complain about. Once you make a long Playlist. Nothing better ðŸ˜Œ,negative
It has been the best songs that i cant listen to on the radio Thank u so much spotify I love u ,positive
I gave this a four the update HORRID HENRY WHAT THE FU PLS FIX THIS i want to listen to my fav song but it is just a preview! fix this now!,negative
I had a great experience listening to music I love..,positive
Spotify is such a great app and I'm extremely happy with the service/benefits since I've started using the app. I give it an unquestionable 5 star!!,positive
Nois Best platform for listening to music,positive
"Love it, though I wish the ads weren't so long, I'm too lazy to buy something to remove them, and they aren't that bad.",positive
"Had no issues with this app for years being a premium user but now really struggling with it. As someone else said before, there is now no player so can't skip, pause etc. Not sure if this is because I'm on a Samsung Galaxy? As it does come back briefly if I restart my phone ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸",negative
"You have to pay to enjoy most things, ads everywhere, whenever I try to play a song it play's something completely different. I'm only using Spotify because the other app I'd normally use doesn't work with this phone, if I could find anything else that I like I'd use it over Spotify any day but it does the job I guess definitely not the worst",negative
"why bother offering shuffle if the same songs play. just changing the arrangement is pathetic n lame,vet a good programmer to write a decent provram that can choose nonrepetitavely",negative
I love this app! I have ditched Pandora and I heart radio!,positive
"Its a good platform for music and podcasts, if it loads, I have to close and reopen the app multiple times just to listen to music, and if I'm not in the app for a bit and try to go back, I have to do it again",positive
It's great. If there was a way (maybe there is) to search your liked list but continue playing... that would be nice.,positive
Uninstalled it as it does not work on my device. Waste of time!,negative
"The lyrics section is so jittery can't stand it anymore, annoys me. Spotify forgets to shuffle the very old songs you liked and I don't know why Spotify don't do it right it's the few same songs that keeps on shuffling in the liked songs section. Spotify if this message reached you please look into it. I love songs in my playlist but it forgets to play those songs and I annoyingly have to play manually.",negative
The update sucks i should be able to choose my own song yet it doesnt let me skip until you buy the premium i say the version before this update is better,negative
Great app that lets me listen to my favorite podcasts without censorship! Keep it up!,positive
"Dismal. Cuts out, constantly having to reboot, shuffle repeats the same songs from a playlist within 2 hours when there is 100 hours of music on it. Appalling",negative
I use this app evey day the only downside is the ads,negative
I couldn't open my Spotify account anymore!,negative
"Any song, any time, no ads. I love my Spotify, it's with the price!",negative
This app is really spot on Love how you can listen to any song of your choice Really nice,positive
It sucks you play a song and it plays a random song so I would give it less than a star,negative
"Pretty good app...the only problem is ads...ohhh the terrible ads...90% of them are trashing at us for not upgrading to premium...as a free app i know they have to make money but, this is just too much...they say watch this short video to get 30 mins of uninterupted listening...short video as if! total of 3 min ads...very short ad indeed! Plus not 30 mins more like 10 mins of listening. Music stops randomly for no reason and we need to go back and press play again...overall 3.5 stars for me....",negative
"I don't like they took away the preview feature for when you select add songs. I used to be able to find new music easily, but now I have to add the song to my playlist to decide if I want it. If I don't like it then I have to go back and delete it.",negative
Something's wrong with my spotify. My downloaded music stops playing when I listen to it offline. It only lasts for 10 minutes.,negative
"Free version is very useless with the very limited functionalities. Good music selection but doesn't make up for 6 skips an hour max, inability to rewind and fast forward. Having ads should be enough don't need all the limitations",negative
Overwhelmed with ads with free content,negative
Currently having this bug of when i open a playlist and at the same time have it so that i can see my other playlist pr search for songs and leave the app while it's playing that the lowered bar of currently playing doesn't show... While i can hear the song... Clicking the play button on the same playlist doesn't work reopening does but it is a bit annoying when I'm having a song up while playing a game Also the whole premium thing but that is less annoying,negative
New glitches are a nightmare. Music keeps stopping. Can't pause or set sleep timer on podcast. The only way I can resolve it is by uninstalling the app and reinstalling. Its a proper pain. I am a premium subscriber too. Please sort ASAP,negative
I love it is so helpful to pay attention,positive
L update,positive
Actually this is a good app for everyone but I hope iphone users and android users doesn't have different features. I hope android users can also have the background sound features.,positive
When internet music arrived in my life there were a lot of learning curves. Then I ran into Spotify and the rest is making my ears happy! If I had to make one suggestion. I would like to have the old album/LP experience. Where you can read who is on the album including musicians just like the old days and you read thus while you are listening to it. Other than that you guys are awesome! THANKS,positive
"Nice collection, Auto play songs is too good ðŸ‘",positive
"Super disappointed lately. I have had Spotify for YEARS. And loved it. Up until the last 2 months. Whatever the new update is, it is GARBAGE. doesn't work 85% of the time, and when it does open up and work, the music drops in and out constantly. I'm not getting the music info on my truck screen anymore and it doesn't connect to my Spotify THiNG anymore either. I am very close to canceling and going with Amazon music. As a LONG TIME paying customer, for premium and family plan, I'm disappointed !",negative
Very adaptiv app Love it thanks,positive
Frequently have issues with the music library disappearing from the app and spotify have done nothing to remove the glitch. Only way to resolve the issue is remove app multiple times and hope one time the new install works!,negative
Great music app I love it I highly recommend it ðŸ‘,positive
"Good listening music, podcast, etc apps",positive
Great music and podcast,positive
Great music,positive
Outstanding...Variety of music for everyone!,positive
"OK. I would like to be able to rewind the songs for about 5 seconds with a click, that would be very useful when trying to learn to play a song. Also i would like to be able to choose lower quality for streaming and download! But, besides from that, it's OK.",positive
I Love this app and there has so many songs my favourite song is there but to one problem is there there has so many ad that's why I am giving only 4 star,negative
"Our family loves Spotify, use it everywhere!",positive
"Google Home speaker volumes never stay at what I set them to when playing via Spotify. Set the volume from Spotify and it resets one speaker (but not the other) back down to ~25%, when I didn't ask it to do that, even if I was turning the volume UP it still resets it down. It's really annoying and it needs to be fixed.",negative
"This app is good my only problem with it is that it doesn't play the music I like it'd always playing random music and it doesn't let you play your liked songs again because if you try it play another random song that you don't like,nor does this app play the music that you search up it plays yet another random song",negative
Ads should be limited,negative
Hate that it doesn't let you play the song you want unless you're premium.,positive
This app is fantastic I love this music app,positive
Yeah I'm disappointed I recently upgraded to premium and that was fine for a while but after every update all my downloads dissappear and won't download again for ages. I was so looking forward to Spotify premium like all my friends but it just doesn't word for me,negative

"A very good application for streaming music, obviously with ads without premium",positive
"I have a love/hate relationship with this app. I dont mind the ads, its the fact that i cant choose what songs i want to listen to anymore. I only get previews of the songs. I can only get 6 skips per hour. I cant do anything i want. Almosr all the songs i like to listen to are only for premium users. You put so many restrictions on us. Id rather pay for tidal. 2022 UPDATE: switched to youtube music my life is so much better ðŸ˜»ðŸ˜»",negative

I used to use Spotify but it is a good app but in my opinion audiomack is better to be honest frfr,positive
"The only thing i want is lossless audio or call it (Low, Normal, High, Very high, PLEASE ADD THIS ""Ultra high"") pls pls pls",negative
This aap is amazing but I can't see the lyrics of the songs even after becoming a premium member.So please solve this problem.,negative
Best music app 10/10 ALL DAY!,positive
"I've discovered so many new music through Spotify and its my go to when sharing music with friends, but lately it's been so annoying when I want to play a different song and it just won't. My app is up to date on updates, it's not a space issue because my phone has plenty of space left, please fix this issue Spotify. Leaning towards canceling my subscription and paying for YouTube if this won't resolve.",negative
Perfect for playing other apps. I have this on my phone and I use it on my PS4; blasting through my television. It's truly a remarkable experience and definitely a app worth utilizing. I also believe purchasing the premium is mandatory if you want the full-on experience especially if you're a music lover!,positive
"Really nice App, I thoroughly enjoying it, ðŸ‘",positive
"Amazing selection, from obscure oldies to,New releases.love it",positive
It's been a great experience. I only had it a few weeks ago. Really like the mix made for me.,positive

It was really good in the beginning and it was fine I had no problem with it the app itself or any of the music that was on but since the new update it will not allow me to access my playlist and six skips is all I get and I have to buy premium na please fix this,negative
This does not even have playback controls for podcasts?! Or does it? Sometimes they simply disappear...,negative
"Great all around, amazing playlists, endless artists and almost endless variety!",positive

My spotify premium is not working. Eventhough i paid for it and i got a receipt too. But it is not updated to the app. It shows only free account. Fix this issue asap.,negative
It a really good app but then there premiun why can everything be free and you can't pick what song you want to lissting to what you have on your own play list when on laptop or computer so I can't stand this app ðŸ˜®â€ðŸ’¨,negative
It has been amazing! My daily mixs had a perfect mix of songs I've never heard but love. I'm enjoying music again thank you Spotify I'm a member for life,positive
Ads are a little annoying but it's their corporate decisions that are driving me away. There is more to life than money.,negative
The song that i love since 90s are all here... maybe a few of those are not but still this is worth it of listening... thank you spotify,positive
Been trying to login for ages- installed- uninstalled- restarted- its just driving me mental- i cant even get past the logim page anymore-,negative
"I love Spotify, everything about it. My only hatred for it is the temptemental connectivity issues when connecting with smart speakers (Google in my case) speakers show up, then their gone, music cuts out at random at times. Which if your having a party is VERY annoying. Music will continue playing on my speakers, but it won't show as a song playing in Spotify, so you have to restart...basically it's massively glitchy when connecting with Google products and it cheeses me off. Fix it!",negative
"Ads with premium account, intrusive banners over lapping podcasts with video. Currently a waste of money, please improve interface and give premium users the main benefit they pay for.",negative
Loved it before and cancelled a few months back due to taking forever to load and all the buffering. Just downloaded it again cuz I miss my playlist and it's still doing the same thing. ðŸ¤¦ðŸ½â€â™‚ï¸,negative
"Buggy UI on samsung zflip 3, sometimes the currently playing box doesn't show up, sometimes the audio get interrupted during a song",negative
"Spotify is a great app and I will always use it to listen to music but I really hate when they add songs to your Playlist it just really isn't necessary at all, I mean it's basically their account and it's like... the government they can do whatever they want if they think it's right for you. All in all spotify is a good app and I recommend it but when you get it make your Playlist over an hour otherwise you will get random songs.",positive
MAKE ME HAPPY,positive
It had moments when it would give ads after ads but now it is far better!,positive
"Everything's Good, just didn't understand the way I can only play the songs from My playlist. It always keeps playing from random selection may be based on the recommended songs. Not very User friendly, I hope it will help",negative
Good app and many good choices they have a playlist for all your favorite artist and those playlist play the artist,positive
No need to test other apps for phone to listen to podcast,positive
i would have given five stars but its four cause of the adds there are allot of adds,positive
"Earlier there was an issue as my Spotify kept pausing and buffering but i contacted the Spotify community and they turned out to be really helpful, ver cooperative particularly my advisor Satarla K. Thanks to the team and definitely a great app.",positive
"There should just be an explicit filter, instead of two different versions of the song. Incredibly annoying finding a good song and finding out its the censored version.",negative
How is it possible to not be able to play the downloaded songs while offline then why did I download it at the first place??,negative
It gets a 3 because even if u download stuff to listen when your off line you can't get into it unless you're on line,negative
I am listening all day long as I do my yard work and great fishing buddy. I'm never board,positive
I bought premium xD,positive
"I was using the lite version then j installed this and i think that lite is better. The like button and skip are too close to each other, so it dislikes the song instead of skipping it and there is undo option for that u have search it again and also it crashes a lot. My phones literally telling me uninstall it bc of the crashesðŸ˜•. And sometines the player also dosent work and it dosent have background player like the lite versionðŸ˜. I getting rid of this one, getting the lite versionðŸ˜§",negative
A great app! been using it for the past 2 years and have never had a problem with it until recently though. the playlist I use the most goes for over 24hrs and I've added a lot of new songs but the hour count stopped going up... is there a way to fix this? I've deleted the app then reinstalled but that didn't work.,negative
Very good app for using music and to listen,positive
Is the app broken or something? I can't see what's currently playing or pause the music. I have to force close the app to get music to stop playing. I also can't like music that is playing.,negative
Shuffle function isn't very shuffle. I have about 500 songs I added to one playlist and I hear only about 20 of them repeated randomly every week on my drives to/from work.,negative
Latest update might as well been a brick. Bugs are bad. Can't see playback menu. Doesn't tell you if anything is playing. Will no longer communicate with phone notifications or toolbar,negative
I've had this app for years and it works great on both iPhone and Android. It's super easy to use and organize. I pay monthly to avoid commercials because it's definitely worth it. There's just no better way to put it. ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŒðŸ¼,positive
I like the way I can find songs easily and tons of songs to chose from,positive
Spotify works wondefuly on tablet and laptop is let's you skip as long as you want even without premium sure there might be some ads but you can always get used to it. With Spotify I spend most of my time just listening to music,positive
I can't open the app this is trash,negative
Way to many ads so get ready to cough up your clean lung to get ads free. audio quality is not original and stupidly compressed but Hey those Ads freakin CRISP!!!!,negative
Very inspiring. I feel blessed everytime i tune in. God bless you guys richly in the precious name of Jesus the Christ!,positive
Best music I just need premium.,negative
"Want to listen to music? . You can listen to any music on Spotify. Music you liked will pop up. You can also have lyrics(if you want them). I love this app so I'm giving it five stars âœ¨ There is an advert every half an hour but if you get prenium, no ads at all! It is a great app and anyone who likes music can install this app!",positive
the hit is so nice,positive
Can't find all my favorite bands. Doesn't always work. That being said I use it all the time. I hope they continue to add artists.,negative
Best app for high quality music and podcasts,positive
I already disliked this app on mobile anyway but the experience i am having is souring my thoughts on it more. On console and desktop its awsone! But on mobile you really would use this. I repeatedly try to skip songs i already have hidden on the first place so they shouldnt play anway but they still do. And even if i hide a song i dont like it still plays which annoys me. You are better off using some other app than this on mobile. 0/10 if i could give it that rating.,negative
"Since the last update my app keeps crashing every 30 to 60 mins (give or take)! I thought it was my phone (Note20 Ultra) but my wife's Flip3 is doing the same thing... please fix this, as a premium member this is unacceptable... Otherwise no other complaints, will change my review as soon as I see a fix to this annoying issue.",negative
"The app used to feel sluggish and slow. Scrolling through my playlists would sometimes lag on my main phone. This has been fixed the performance of the app itself is much better right now I am loving it again, good job!",positive
It takes minutes to start any podcast,negative
It used to be great but now i have to delete and re install the app to be able to control my songs or it'll be stuck saying one song but play another.,negative
"Best music app ever, I used to spend 100 bucks a month on CDs but now 9.99 is all and the best part is that this app finds great new music I would never have found! I LOVE YOU SPOTIFY ""PLATONIC OF COURSE""!",positive
it's difficult to understand at times but the desktop version is fire and it just puts random songs instead of the song you want to play,negative
When using the app on the Samsung watch 4 it does not start playing and starts searching for Bluetooth,negative
It is a very nice app. I personally liked it and even in offline it is working also. Very cool app.,positive
How much money you want to earn Spotify Yes,positive
The stupidest app really. You take premium for a week and you can download only 30 songs?! Disgusting. Never spending one more penny on this useless app.,negative
I want to play only a single song but I guess I have to pay for that,negative
I think it will be more exciting and useful if we can download and use it as ringtone,negative
"I love Spotify and use it every single day for years now. BUT PLEASE, CHANGE THE SHUFFLE BUTTON BACK TO HOW IT USED TO BE.",negative
"I like Spotify, oh by the way my neighbor turned me on to this decent app that's organized too!! Gots some playlists going on there as well , ty for accepting my profile ....",negative
"The app goes into endless loop during right code acceptance,and says something went wrong. Whereas if the code input is incorrect,it immediately says it's wrong.",negative
"lol, I'm so used to Spotify, i can't even thinking of switching it. This is great and even their chat support is awesome.",positive
"Without the premium this app is crazy and you can't even skip. And whenever you go on an app, it glitches like crazy. Honestly, I'd be better with youtube. I hope you have a good experience but I know I'll didn't.",negative
getting crashed again and again,negative
Exceptional and unique I am satisfied with this app,positive
Awesome app that's why I am giving 5 stars without ads and clear music and number of playlists than you Spotify ...,positive
"It shuffles podcasts by default with no clear way to turn off the ""feature"". I'm also trying to use it with a Bluetooth headset and it keeps pausing randomly for no reason.",negative
Can't preveiw songs before you add them to your playlist,negative
I like it a lot just as long as your using Spotify premium,positive
"No man Spotify, you are such a good app, but why did you change the layout of the ""previous, play"" and ""next"" buttons? It's awkward to look at. Please give me an opinion to change it back to normal in the settings atleast coz my OCD is Hella triggered ðŸ˜­ ðŸ™",negative
Super good music and really easy to figure out if u just started to use it is recommend,positive
Not working since last 3 days!!! No support available,negative
app constantly crashes and freezes,negative
The app has lots of ads that any one don't like,negative
Simple and good app to listen to old or new songs. You can find almost all the songs on a click..,positive
Yes on my phone no skips (other than 6 an hour) but on my computer (which is mobile) I can skip what ever I want. On my phone I can't just pick a song but on my computer I can... I love that it will load about 5-10 songs before it goes offline... witch is great in my car,positive
"Dear Spotify team, Please, get your Dev and QA team together. The sync between PC and the mobile is bloody bugged, that results in the invisible UI of currently played song in the app AND in frozen player in the notification section. Each time I must restart the app to fix it. Additionally, sometimes (due to sync) the app wont play anything, unless I disable the internet. It was not a problem a year ago, thus, would kindly appreciate to fix the above problems. Best regards, Loyal customer",negative
I like Spotify for the different songs I pick one thing or the other and it plays songs I know and like and if I don't like or know the song I can just skip it I haven't seen anything saying I skipped to much and can't skipped a song,positive
It's great now I can use this app at my country cause previously you couldn't connect to it,positive
"I love Spotify but everytime I try to listen to it, it keeps cutting off. I have to either unlock my phone to start it again or go back into the app. Please can this be sorted.",negative
"Update: the prev problems seemed to be fixed. The only issue I'm seeing now is that the podcast that I listen to won't always be marked as ""played"" and if I do sort the played ones out it doesn't always filter them out the 1st time. Old: I really want to give this app a 5 because I use it every day and I want it to be better but it's been acting up lately and I've been getting frustrated with it. For the most part it's a great app. There's a wide variety of artists and sounds great.",positive
"So many issues at the moment, won't connect to car properly, won't show what I'm playing have to close app for the app to work, if this continues I'll be leaving Spotify at the end of the month",negative
Very nice app for sound,positive
Crashes a ton on S10+. too much COVID noise blocking everything. Reviews being deleted by Big Brother Tech,negative
I use this app to listen to podcasts whether it's crime or documentary and I LOVE IT!,positive
It help in study and others works to relaxing,positive
Podcasts and experience is very good,positive
Have been more than a satisfied customer now for over 8 years. Thanks Spotify,positive
"Accidentally deleted my old review. I have been a Premium user since day one. Last year (21) Spotify had some serious issues, but it's back on track. Spotify remains the best music streaming platform.",positive
"Well honestly speaking I like the last version more than the new one, you simply can't play a playlist without songs you didn't want to play,popping up,you simply can't play your favorite song because a song that you didn't want to play will then play honestly I don't know what happed Liked the old version more even thou the new version has some cool stuff itheres still some hiccups on it",positive
I can't even open the app anymore I can't listen to music,negative
one song one ad of 30 second.... really very dissapointed with spotify... rudiculous way to beg for the money...,negative
Good music choices.,positive
"Very slow, keeps crashing, removed car mode",negative
Good app,positive
App doesn't even work half the time and when it does work I have to try and navigate whatever pointless ui changes they made with the current patch. Sick of this garbage app,negative
All my downloaded songs are gone somehow. Now Im unable to play offline. Worst experience ever.,negative
The only thing I dont like is constant ads. Or I can't click on the music I want to play unless I have premium,negative
It's very easy to search music ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶,positive
Definitely has mind of its own I will not upgrade to premium until I start to see some positive reviews actually thinking about switching music apps,positive
"Generally a great app, but I've got a few suggestions, mainly for podcasts. Can we get a function to 'save a place' or bookmark in a podcast. I'll often switch podcasts and then have to scroll back and try to find where I left off with the original. Also a search function within a specific podcast 'menu', some pods are hundreds of episodes long, so being able to search key words/titles without going through years of episodes would be awesome.",negative
I rlly like this app but when its update i cant play my fav song and i rlly hate the new update so pls work with it,negative
This latest update prevents the app from working at all. As soon as I click a playlist it freezes.,negative
"The best music app I've downloaded. They create the best playlists, aligning with my taste",positive

Keep allowing freedom of speech on this platform and it will continue to be the go to for streaming.,positive

"A lot of stability improvements lately , good effort",positive
"I've been using Spotify every single day for many years now. There have always been a few bugs here and there, but it was fine. Spotify is the most important app to me and it is almost constantly in use by me. But now the bugs have made the app almost unusable; the music is suddenly stopping, songs are randomly skipped and I'm not able to pause/skip songs myself, because the app shows me that I'm not actually playing a song?! I always have to force stop the entire app in order to stop the music.",negative
Has been good to me. No bugs or glitches sooo far.,negative
Great app. Smooth experience. Sometimes connections can drop but not necessarily the apps issue,positive
The newest update is making the app almost unusable. No controls to play/pause or skip. Please revert back to the old update or I'm going to delete the app.,negative
At first i downloaded the app only to listen to BTS but i ended up listening to all my favorite artists it's a wonderful application,positive
I have never left a review because this app was perfect. Now it stops randomly several times while playing a song. And it doesn't show what song is playing. Fix this or I'm ending my subscription,negative
"Tons of errors, doesn't even display the song playing. Older version was like awesome.",negative
Love to hear the type of music I enjoy and not have to endure certain other types that you get on regular programming.,positive
It's literally so annoying how when i play music from my custom playlist it plays music that isn't even on there and when look on settings it doesn't even change .. why is it playing songs that aren't on my playlist.,negative
"I like the app, but the ads are awful. And the 30 minutes of ad free music doesn't work. When I say the ads are awful, I have gotten more than 7 in a row once. I just want to listen to music and I am okay with listening to some ads but 7 in a row is just stupid.",negative
Love Spotify it has good music and good sound good for its purpose,positive
"This is a good app, I just have one complaint. They'll delete songs from the app, I don't know the full reason why either. Take Motive x Promiscuous for example, it was one of my favorite songs and they deleted it. It kinda sucks, especially if it's a song you enjoy listening to.",negative
"I really love it bcz i love songs to and listening a story horror story, funny story, sad story, romantic story, that u can listen in Spotify you can listen any songs and story and u will enjoy it i promise",positive
Very good experience with every podcast that I come across with! The podcasts that I have on my Spotify can also be seen on my blog.,positive
Recently the app seems to have many bugs. Song covers won't load. Spotify connect across multiple devices sometimes just doesn't work. Shows a different song playing on my phone then what is actually being played on the laptop. This is also not a problem with internet because this problem persists even when I'm home on my wifi.,negative
"App is unusable in the last 3 weeks. Music stops playing with locked screen, control bar and recently played is also missing. This is completely unacceptable for a service that we are paying for.",negative
"Great App, use it for my podcasts.",positive
I can't find the button to share lyrics...any solution please,negative
Super sound quality i love the all songs and this app,positive
"For the love of god just rollback the most recent update. This application is basically unusable now with songs skipping, randomly not allowing controk over playing/pausing the song, not even showing what song is playing, etc. Considering unsubscribing until this is resolved.",negative
I love Spotify so much this is so easy to use and you can make it on playlist I listen to my playlist all day and everyday,positive
"The apps keep freezing, the menu disappears and you can't move to the next track or previous... please fix all these bugs",negative
"Well, good app but there is only two problems I don't wanna tell you to give the premium app for free but just about some glitches which are not at all good. I can't play any song that I search but I can play the song which I have added to my playlist, even my net is 5mbps then also your app shows you don't have any connection. But your app is good just you need to fix this problems that's all. Thankyou.",positive
"I love spotify, it's made things so much easier and cheaper for me over itunes. But the app has issues. Sometimes it chugs just loading my liked songs. I have them downloaded, it should only really be loading a UI element. After force stopping, clearing cache, and reopening the app, WHY TF am I still staring at a black screen waiting for my liked songs to load god knows when? Shuffle is also fake, I can tell it's only a small loop of songs. Its worse now too, sometimes it'll be like 20 songs now",negative
Make it not lag on low end phones ,positive
"My downloads won't play, this why i'm paying the premium. hopefully it will be fixed soon",negative
Worst app ever you cannot skip a song plus you cannot listen to a specific song. Don't download it. They're giving advertisements lije its a best app in the world. Disappointed!!!!,negative
esta buena,positive
"Got rid of car view. Dumb decision, specially when it worked perfectly",negative
Love it,positive
"Everything was excellent. However, they seem to have removed the feature to listen to a short preview of a song when making a Playlist. This has made it impossible to find new songs you are interested in for your Playlist. Horrible feature to remove.",negative
Great streaming platform,positive
If you don't mind ads every fee no more than the radio.. you can make your own Playlist and put it on shuffle and maybe like me your Playlist has music from before you were born to things your kids listen to.every genre ... share some of music love with your Ä·ids . I just made a Playlist for my daughter and she's thinking about changing to Spotify. Maybe we will be upgrading soon,negative
It's a incredible app and for me is very helpful because I can download music,positive
Keeps cutting out 40 seconds into a song when screen is switched of. Only happened since the last update,negative
"This used to be a 5 star app, but your development team clearly keep making unnecessary changes just to have something to do. You got rid of driving mode 3 months ago and promised a replacement that's yet to appear so now I can no longer safely change my music while driving, and then you did something to your podcast system so that for a few months now the ""continue listening"" section of the ""new episodes"" playlist no longer works consistently. Get it together.",negative
Not good But not bad,positive
The Spotify is the best app for song,positive
"Settings for not work, have the setting turned off where spotify add song that are similar yet they still play getting annoyed of listening to bands o don't want to hear. I made a Playlist to listen. To what I want to hear not your suggestions.",negative
"This is horrible, i loved using spotify and now for almost 2 years, i've tried MULTIPLE times to download spotify, i can only download spotify lite, but i had better experience with spotify, yet it won't let me download it. This used to be my favorite platform to listen to music but now it's not worth it. :(",negative
NICE,positive
Does not save songs and charged after 3 months after deleting account. Not happy.,negative
This app is fantastic,positive
Good,positive
"Pretty Glitchy, Wont stop downloading thousands of what I'm assuming are songs. It doesn't say what it's downloading in the notification or when I click on said notification. Just keeps downloading literal thousands of things. Using my data, slowing my phone, taking up disk space.",negative
Worst music app ever. Spotify used to be best but now not able to play song. Extreme lag.,negative
I like Spotify because can listen to any song And the song he also best I love Spotify because can listen to any song And the song song he also best I love Spotify ðŸ™‚,positive
The Spotify,positive
Too many ads. Has a wide range of songs but it plays an add after every song.,negative
"AMAZING!!! Where else can you get unlimited downloads and no commercials for $9.99?? I have nearly 500 songs on my Playlist. Who needs a radio, mp3 or CDs with an applied this. Been using it for years no and will never stop.",positive
Seems to be one of the better music apps,positive
The great thing about Spotify is that it isn't woke! Long live Spotify!,positive
Awesome!! I don't even need to store music in my phone. Everything is here on Spotify. Already organised for me as well. Very impressed with the app.,positive
Spotify premium for students is a very affordable and high quality service provided by Spotify. I haven't experienced any problems with the app yet and I've been using for it for 2 years now.,positive
Good,positive
Great but trouble removig songs,negative
"If you start canceling people I will cancel this app, believe that. Don't follow the stupids or you will loose the money you love the most. MERICA!!",negative
"It just send a ad,cannot reply music and send what music i dont like.",negative
Nice collection. Easy to find.,positive
"Buggy mess on samsung fold. Whoever fault it is, the OS does not pick up spotifys audio stream as media, so once you start playing a song it cannot be stopped or interacted with without quitting the app. Audio continues to pay in background on other apps such as YouTube",negative
I liked spotify but there is one issue in it you can download in premium account but the drawback is you need to download whole album rather than a song of one's choice.,negative
This to me is the best app on any phone. I use this app all the time from playing very soft music to playing classic rock and roll,positive
"Spotify is an outstanding music platform, with different genres for all types of music orientated people. Signed G",positive
Just decided to start loading super slow lately. Deleted cache and reinstalled and no better,negative
"Spotify is really great service I use it quite a bit. I wish they would bring back car mode for the people who can't afford the $80 spotify ""car thing"" remote.",positive
Great app for listening songs but the ads are to manyðŸ˜and that's make it worseðŸ™„ but quality of songs are really great but still gonna give this 2 stars because the ads are really annoying,negative
Works great for the most part. Usually a few times I lose control from my ear buds and have to force close Spotify to get it to work again. Now I get a Bluetooth pop-up that happens every time I launch the app and happens regardless of if I accept or not,negative
I listen to this great app everyday and be looking out for my single @bmkdon,positive
I have to shuffle my playlist just to listen to the songs I actually like and it's just annoying fix your app,negative
i like using spotify because i find all my favorite songs in it and other things that may please everyone but the only problem is that it needs wifi and you can't skip just 5 times per hour ..but i still like it,positive
App works well but as soon as the screen turns off your music stops playing. Very annoying and I'm thinking of switching from this app to another music app,negative
"It's free, has the music I like, there are a lot of commercials but they gotta pay their bills too, so not gonna hate on them for it. Overall pretty satisfied.",negative
"Every song is available, & best interface among others.",positive
It's very good once you pay for it as premium. One set back is trying rearrange your Playlist. It has no album images to match the song when editing it. Other that it's working really well.,positive
please make it able to use Google Play balance to pay the membership..,negative
This app is amazing . I can find Every song exist . And one thing that this is add free . Add free music at free of cost .,positive
I LOVE this app immediately and still love. Thank you makers of Spotify Edit: Still nice,positive
"I haven't used this app a lot, but I appreciate greatly having been able to view on Spotify a couple of controversial podcasts that many other services weren't airing. Thanks, Spotify, for your courage and commitment to free speech!",positive
I am satisfied with Spotify.I don't have premium so after 4 or 5 songs 29 second's ad is play.But for these ads i don't have any complain.They have amazing and perfect playlists for any mood and time.And without any premium song's audasity never been change or less.So in short I Love Spotify and my downloading data do not geting west.ðŸ˜‹ðŸ¤—ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜‡,positive
"Used to just play what was on my playlist, now it throws in random songs I don't care for.",negative
"I like this app very much. World's all songs are here, I can listen Hindi, English and also Punjabi songs anytime and I have made different types of playlist for songs.",positive
"It has a nasty habit of mixing Red Hot Chili Peppers in with my death metal playlists, but other than that, it's pretty good.",positive
Well.......what.....to....say.....about this app it's great as you all know and heard of. For the ones who are K-POP fans it's great for them.....â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ðŸ˜˜,positive
Listening songs is my hobby . And spotify helps me Thank you so much,positive
"6 skips per hour, wow so i cant even skip to the song i want to listen to since it didnt let me just click on it to listen to that song. I aint gonna talk about the mass amount of ads and that skipping songs is a premium Feature. I feel like they only care about the money, not about the thoughts lf people. Id rather use Youtube Music since they let me play a certain song and not just a PREVIEW of it. Really dissapointed for such a large and wide spreaded app",negative
"Shocking. Won't play for more than a few seconds, keeps crashing, and cannot see the what's playing bar anymore. Trying to update and just get the spinning wheel of doom. I'm taking my money elsewhere ðŸ˜’",negative
"normally fine but past week the option to pause/view music playing in and off of app won't show, also meaning i can't connect/disconnect from speakers. It randomly stops playing then replays much later. uninstalled and reinstalled and updated but no different. need to turn off phone to reset app & stop music, samsung s21.",negative
It always log out when my data depletes and always requires me to download the playlists i have already downloaded all over again. I'm done with this app!!,negative
"This app crashes regularly won't show what's playing when I open the app, will play after the apps been closed generally super buggy.",negative
I absolutely love Spotify! I can create Playlist that suit my every mood!!,positive
"Constantly crashes, restarts what I'm listening to, and frequently makes me have to restart my phone. Every new update is a new problem. Absolutely embarrassing for a company of this size.",negative
This app is good but if you put Romanized lyrics it could be better but it's good,positive
So many ads but the playlist is amazingðŸ”¥ðŸ’¯,positive
"The app sucks. I pay for dual membership and it constantly stops on its own for no reason, not connected to anything. The play bar disappears and the only way to pause it is to close the app entirely. It constantly rewinds itself 10 seconds when playing podcasts. And it's not just my phone it's my husband's too. Both are fairly new phones. It's ridiculous to pay for a service as much as we do and they can't even get the app to work properly. And I do have auto updates turned on.",negative
Minus 1 star because I can't Sort My Episodes in A/Descending Date order. I want to listen to the oldest episodes without scrolling for days. (4/12/33),negative

Good Quality Sound best online ..but thank you Spotify by free share with friend....,positive

It's just not good anymore. they keep removing features to try to get people to pay for premium. it's almost gotten unusable with how many ads I get. a few wouldn't be bad considering it's free but the amount of ads I get is absolutely excessive. and I'm absolutely sick of features being removed. I'm genuinely starting to hate this app despite using it for years. I'm getting fed up.,negative
"You know, just the best music app.",positive
"The playing now bar has disappeared again, and it keeps happening. There's no way yo pause, stop, or skip music without it. This has been an issue for over two months. Fix it spotify.",negative
Awesome. This is best music app by far,positive
Every time I open the app or return to the app after having it in the background it asks me to allow bluetooth no matter how many times i hit allow,negative
I give this a 5 star because the app is designed well for Teens and adults. I really don't mine the ads on this app. My favorite part about this app is it has a setting for Explicit content. It shows E so I know if itis going to say bad stuff. I really injoy that because I don't like bad stuff. Also thay have clean versions of songs that I love. Thanks,negative
"my last review was about me not being able to use Spotify because it's ""offline"" my wifi is turned on and I have stable service. I cleared my cache, didn't work so I cleared my storage. When I tried to log in it didn't work! I know the password. tried logging in on my laptop it worked! I uninstalled the app, I place my info so I can log it it says 'logging in' it took so long so I sent myself an email, I press it it takes SOOOOO long again but all it says ""link has expired""it wasn't even 4hrs!!!",negative
Easily the best way to hear your favourite music and listen to artists you've never heard of but Spotify reckon you'll love. It educates your ears!,positive
"Music Freedom on Spotify. If you don't like it here, then leave.",positive
"I hate this app so much, it never made me delete my Spotify before but now I have too ðŸ™„ a way to lose customers ðŸ˜¤ I'm never paying for premium again",negative
Everything is good but your premium adds There is no skip option we have to listen adds till end and dont have option to proceed backward or forward I hope your team as soon as recover this problem that I face,positive
Excellent!!! I â¤ myself some Spotify music! I can fix my music to suit my listening ear. I â¤ it. Try it for yourself.,positive
"So I have problem with ""Slow down! Only 6 skips per hour!"" AND YOU ARE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO EXIT THE SONG AND PICK THE ONE YOU WANT TO HEAR! Can you fix this? IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE SONGS THAT I LIKE!",negative
They make it incredibly hard to cancel. I had to go through the process twice. I thought I had already cancelled but no they have charged me for another month. I had planed on re- subscribing in the future but after this experience I will never use Spotify again.,negative
Love the classical rock and any new. I want be a music curator . L,positive
Honestly I don't see anything wrong with this app. I've never had any issues with Spotify or anything like that.,positive
Great music follow up with other music instrest.,positive
I like spotify its the only music app that I know that keeps playing while you go out of it and do other things. I love that plus for whatever reason you don't have any service just change it to offline and you still can listen to your music. I would recommend spotify to anyone. Well worth the money.,positive
I can't open the app it says something went i tried many ways but i can't fix it please check it,negative
5 Stars because you didn't give in to the cancel culture politics of the day. I will support Spotify as long as their platform continues to allow free speech for all. This site should be for entertainment not be directing and controlling people's minds.,negative
"I love this app, all the music I listen to in one place! I have premium, which is AWESOME, though sometimes it glitches and the song will play but it won't come up on the app so I can't pause it or anything but other than that it's great. If you don't have premium it kinda sucks because you can't even really choose the songs you wanna play, which annoyed me before I got premium, but it's still so good ðŸ˜ðŸ’…âœ¨ good job.",positive
"I don't like the mobile features, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT SHUFFLE! but the music access is nice. I give it 3 stars",positive
"Horrible, always crashes and stops playing",negative
Very topical and interesting,positive
I'm very happy with Spotify they know my music and I know what kind of music I love!,positive
"When my playlist song is done, it started playing random suggested song and wont play back my playlist. It is annoying and I also recieve alot of ads after just listening to a song from my playlist",negative
Spotify Fix your App!! It's messing up again.,negative
I have had nothing but good experiences except trying to load a $30 card I bought at a store. I can't seem to load it anywhere,negative
Nice ads once in a life time I get to hear the songs,positive
ive loved this app since first using it in 2008. the more i learn how to use it the more i love and praise it. i have a large library! Still living it 2022. I use other apps but always come back to them,positive
Was working perfectly until these new updates. I have to make Playlist for any genre now if I want to listen to just country or whatever while at work. The song genre tabs are useless now. Version 8.7.28.1217 did nothing but go backwards to me. Guess I just have podcast to depend on atleast.,negative
"This app used to be fantastic, but after these last two updates it's gotten super buggy. I would wait until it's fixed to bother with it, honestly.",negative
Great job...now we can distribute our misic easy,negative
Cant seem to remove songs from my queue or even see a list of songs on my queue.,negative
Best music /podcasts app available!!!!,positive
All of my favorite podcasts from all aspects of my recreational life to my professional life in one place.,positive
"Limited song options and if you don't have premium like I did you'll experience so many advertisements that is ridiculous. I remember one time on my way to school I had 10 minutes worth of just advertisements, I don't know if it wouldn't gone longer before I turned it off.",negative
Great app. Easy to use. I love the interface for podcasts!,positive
Always a good follow through to my playlist!,positive
I think it's good but so many ads are there,positive
Constantly crashing. My wife was complaining about it crashing all the time and now she's fine. But now mine keeps crashing. Get a new I.T department because it's becoming unusable.,negative
Absolutely fantastic. All the music I want and need is here.,positive
"Very good collection, hope to hear more good music.",positive
Fantastic app! One of the best choices these days. They respect freedom of speech. Love all their options of podcasts We can pick and choose what we listen to. I will 100% support them always. A+. And it's free!,positive
Its nice,positive
Can't use my Bluetooth headset to watch podcasts as it thinks I'm in the car,negative
"Good source of music, but it would be nice to be able to add an rss feed for podcasts not already in their library. Also, add a setting so I can make it not automatically play my last song when I open the app. I understand some people want that, but I don't. Just give me an option.",negative
Very good app for free music,positive
It us good if we have subscription and if we don't have subscription then it is worst,negative
"Beena happy, monthly premium paying customer for a couple years. About to cancel and head to Pandora if the sudden app shutdowns and glitches aren't addressed, the widget doesn't show what's playing, poor connectivity and control through Bluetooth devices. All since the last update. Early April 2022",negative
"Fedup with ads. Yes you wantus to buy premium but for that these many ads, uff annoying",negative
"Great music selection tonight, just a little pricey",positive
"Latest update has removed a lot of functionality - can no longer access the song playing in the play list, so cannot stop shuffle. Very frustrating and disappointing.",negative
"Recently I've been having issues with my mobile app, sometimes a song will play but the profile of that song will be a different song, it's laggy. I normally fixed the issue by restarting my phone or updating my spotify app. My most annoying issue though is that I can't even open my mobile app anymore, it just leaves me on the black loading splash screen page with the green logo but never loads. It kinda sucks right now considering I pay for premium. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10",negative
I try to play a song that I always listen to and it plays something else not the song i want to listen to at all. I can go right to YouTube listen to it without no problems on YouTube at all.,positive
Spotidy trying to connect to a device successfully and then working the entire time is impossible! I also wish I could block artists on the app. EDIT: Now my songs skip around randomly without me touching them.,negative
When we go to someone's profile not the artists ofc give us the ability to contact them through Discord or any apps that are connected with Spotify,negative
"It's not fixing the issue related Lisa, Everytime her account get hacked , even after request and mass mailing to Spotify, still no response Very very very poor app",negative
Keeps showing no internet connection tried all setting and suggestions doesn't work. Buyed premium and this happens.,negative
Mostly easy to use,positive
"I've got spofity premium, downloaded a few songs but the downloaded songs never play without internet, please fix this",negative
I just lost over 700 of my downloaded songs for seemingly no reason!! What just happened?,negative
"This is a well done app, it has background play even when you're phone is off. But the best part is the music diversity and it will recommend music to you no matter what genera!",positive
"A few major bugs including the play/pause bar disappearing occasionally, and queues not functioning properly with duplicated/incorrect songs. (very difficult to rearrange songs across 'Next in Queue' and 'Next From') I also have an issue where if I tap on a song outside the queue, it will just play whatever is next in queue instead. Reopening and reinstalling hasn't helped",negative
Wouldn't hurt to have Shazam like capabilities to listen and save music on the fly.,positive
They would add their songs to MY PLAYLIST! I can't make a playlist without having songs I didn't put on it on.,negative
"Every every song I look for is there....,. Still haven't found a song that isn't on there",negative
Experience been great so far! Really enjoy using it...,positive
Best Music much better than YT music cool features,positive
"This app has BUGS! This app dose work well but every time I use it, it has some form of glitch and it is usually related to the ads, it needs to be fixed. Without this bug I would give this app a 5 star rating.",negative
"Good selection of music, but the app is basically unusable without premium. Without premium, you can only play full albums and playlists, you can't fast forward or rewind songs, you can only skip five songs in per hour, and you can't go back songs on playlists or albums. The worst part is that all of these premium features are free when using Spotify on PC and Mac.",negative
I've found even just letting my music playlists play out till Spotify starts choosing things I might like is so much more enjoyable than other music apps. Plus I've definitely stuck around for the Joe Rogan experience podcast. Don't ever cave Spotify!,positive
"This is the app other music apps copy, plus they support human rights",negative
"Amazing app to listen songs like not amazing but bestest But, even if I say let's not talk about ads, yet I would complain for it like it's dude too many ads after every 3 songs that's duh! Sorry for the 3 star rating cause' if the ads sruff doesn't change then my rating won't too humbly saying thanks:)",negative
Great way to listen to my favorite songs of the Gospel,positive
To much ads and it could improve podcast offer and presentation.,negative
I really love this app and it would to Amajin if u guys add karaoke in this app âœ¨,positive
"I like the app so much , but the fact that I cant choose the song I want from my playlist is so painfull , and you can even imagine how painfull it is ... and now I am thinking to transform to another platform to play my music .",negative
"Please fix this app. I don't know what's been done during the last few updates, but it doesn't work anymore! I can't connect my phone to the Spotify app in my car anymore, the app crashes constantly, plays music when the app isn't even open or won't play anything when it is open! Absolutely shocking. Used to love Spotify, but the lack of working functionality within the app has me seriously considering going elsewhere.",negative
"Pathetic. No indication where shuffle is, and only plays 10 seconds of yr 'liked' songs from yr lists that you've spent ages compiling. Then, if you do manage to play a full song, instead of playing the next on the album it plays its own recommended one for you as though IT knows you. Totally spoilt afternoon in the sun listening to what I thought would be music I like.",negative
"Most irritating app ever, I've never found as much advertisement in spotify apart from any other apps... I understand their will be ads in other apps as well but spotify is just too much...",negative
Very good no problem Best music app My favorite app ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ˜ðŸ˜,positive
Awesome .... missing Joni Mitchell and a few others.,negative
good,positive
"My wife and I are both using the free version and we love it. You can find almost any song you want from any era you want. You can make playlists which I love. Having a pumped up workout playlist really helps in the mornings and I create my own radio for work with my office tunes playlist. I'm a Big fan of this app. If you love music, you will also love this app.",positive
This app keeps saying im offline and can't connect to the Internrt while on Spotify making me restart my hole phone to listen to music I don't have downloaded. This ussed to happen every week or so but not happens multiple times a day this sucks because enow I can even use the app for music please fix This,negative
Missing must-have features.,negative
"The app is good, but the lyric won't show for nun of the songs",positive
Love music & podcasts.,positive
"Spotify used to be fantastic a few years ago, but idk whats happened recently, its always crashing and my music stops randomly, or it freezes up on me. Its still great to listen to music but im hoping it stops crashing",negative
ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜¡ worst ...continuous ads.! Irritating,negative
"I enjoy and have used this app for years. However, if they decide to cancel Joe Rogan pod cast because of cancel culture attack on free speech, then I and many like me would be forced to move on to another platform. Please stay strong and stand up to anti free speech pressures. If you don't like something, don't listen to it. Freedom of choice.",negative
So many adds,positive
Very nice app to lessen songs on own choice ðŸ‘,positive
Good,positive
Been a very nice music app that so far has every song and/or artist that I've searched and played. Very good would recommend it ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ‘,positive
I think this app is incredible I use it all the time and I love the music I find on it.,positive
When I click on a song it plays this song I'm not clicking on,negative
This app is very good ðŸ‘ I can listen to all my favorite songs ðŸŽµ,positive
"The fact that spotify won't allow you to clear your history and start a fresh is beyond stupid. I've been bombarded with chinese kids songs and no matter what I do I cannot remove them from my suggestions despite blocking artists as many artists and songs as possible. All I want is to reset my account but apparently it's not possible so I've been left with no alternative but to cancel my family subscription and look elsewhere for my music, spotify is an utter disgrace.",negative
"It's a good app, but I do have a couple of problems with it. It works great and all, it's just that when you click on a playlist, you can't see every song that's in the playlist. I feel like that's the entire point. And you can't play songs in order. It's only shuffle play, nothing else. And if you search up a song, it shows the playlist for it instead of the song. For instance, if you searched ""Lost Boy"", it would give you ""Lost Boy playlist"" instead. It's good for basic use, though.",positive
Cool now that I can finally see the lyrics (I bought premium so I can't complain about anything),positive
Remind me to never buy a subscription. Literally tried using Spotify to listen to a song. I understand the concept of shuffle play but what is the point of I never get to listen to the song I want for past two days. Fix your money grab issue first!,negative
Ever since the last update my Spotify hasn't been working correctly. It randomly pauses. Sometimes the next/play/pause buttons are gone. It doesn't connect to my pioneer stereo on Spotify anymore. UPDATE YOUR FREAKING APP!,negative
"Spotify is great. They have everything you can think of to listen to, be it music or podcasts",positive
"EXCEPTIONAL !!! If I subscribe to Spotify, will the subscription be subjected to Vat and how is the subscription collected? Can I pay for a 12 month contract or perhaps set-up a direct debit contract? Please let me know.",negative
"The play portion of spotify just disappears on a regular basis. The only way i can get it to return is to shut down the app and restart it. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app and the issue comes back immediately. Recently songs and podcasts also just stop playing. I have to go in and hit play to get them going again. That is if the play section is working. If not, it's restart the app. System stability has been a real issue lately.",negative
I want to try to listen to a new album using shuffle play but the next song i hear is the song that's not on the album. The song that's play is another singer album and after that i tap next but the next song isn't on the same album. It's a random song. So how can i hear all the song in the same album if the next song always a different album,negative
Have to uninstall EVERY TIME I want to play MP3s stored on my device. When Spotify is on my phone it forces me to use it to open my personal MP3s but it fails to open them and crashes - so forced to uninstall Spotify every time I want to listen to them. Cancelled my subscription as a result.,negative
Recent update broke app. The player widget in the app and on the home screen disappears. I literally have to force close the app constantly to just use it. This update has been out for a week and it still hasn't been fixed. Why am I paying for this?,negative
Great app for various forms of song,positive
Unusable trash. Spinning green wheel of death when trying to play anything.,negative
Loving this. Without subscription it is so nice so no need of premium,positive
It was nice and I loved to listen to music to drown out the noises or to draw but one day I was off to listen to music but it didn't let me choose music and I thought it was a glitch so I uninstalled the app the reinstalled it back but it still happened please put it to that we can choose the song and not randomize it,positive
doesnt save offline to sd card properly,negative
Idk what has happened to this perfect app really disappointing,negative
Why do you change my lock screen saver? Stupid ! Dont ever install this app.. If you listen for songs then they they will have your screen saver lock and no one knows how to remove it. Apart from this app is fantastic. Iam going to uninstall after commenting as I donno how to remove the spotify screen saver.,negative
"Not at all working, doesn't open at all...... When you select a song to play, the app is automatically shut",negative
It's great minus last update now you can't preview songs before adding,positive
This app is great but It's really annoying with the 30 minutes of no adds to having close to 30 minutes worth of adds,negative
I want translate lyrics feature in English ðŸ¤§ I want to listen BTS music wid English subtitles on Spotify â¤ï¸,negative
Nice great to listen to all my podcast and enjoy music..,positive
This is not a great app at all I really hate this new freaking update! When I wanted to skip from my like songs from Angry Alex to Expurgation FNF it wouldn't let me play!!! Why do I have to get premium to skip songs?!!!? That makes absolutely no sense at all!!! If you want me to rate it 5 stars put it back of how it was before. What's even worse it even plays music that's not even Im my playlist!!just fix this! I don't like it!!!,negative
"I hate this new update!! I can't even listen to my favorite songs anymore without it having to shuffle it to another, and so I had decided to make a playlist with just one song in it so I could listen to it but spotify decided to add more songs to it that I dont even like and I cant even listen to the songs I like anymore, I used to love using spotify but now I hate it ever since this stupid update came out! I'm not using this app anymore until they fix this trashy update!",negative
It's nice and easy to use. Very effective for accessing any songs. But i hate the minute-by-minute advertisement that interrupts my usage of the app. Too much advertisements took awatmy interest in this app.,negative
I give 5 because search level of songs is brilliant ðŸ‘ keep it up and every song is available here great spotify,positive
Can listen to music for free with ads but won't play what you pick. Good for a station I guess.,negative
The is very simple and smart to use,positive
This app is so so so so ruined they have to make it so I can at least choose any song I want they can keep any other feature all I want is to play my favorite songs that's all and they have ruined pls make it so you can choose any song you want,negative
Its a great app but there starting to use to many adds.,positive
I like the app and the music but I don't like how we can't do almost anything with out premium. Like I cant repeat songs and other kind of random songs pop in when I'm listening to my playlist.,negative
I love this app however I rate this a 4.99 since they do not allow it on later than iOS 13 and my daughter wanted it on her iPod touch and she cant but other wise awesome app!!!!! <3333333333,positive
"Good for music but there are too many ads , every 2 songs i listen to there is a double add",negative
"Something has been happening when I try to listen to my playlist, it always plays songs I don't want and it's annoying, it plays recommended songs and even when I turn off autoplay please fix this.",negative
Great music app. Easy to use,positive
Very nice good work but remove those ads,negative
"I love the app, but but songs' lyrics aren't available at all. I have Spotify on my laptop, too, but I have lyrics there. I've tried to contact support, but they didn't help me Upd.: Lyrics fixed, thank you!",negative
"Spotify is GREAT, without ads so i got premium. What the sayin once you go black you never go back well it's the same for premium like you are not gonna miss them like 1 min ads like it interrupts the vibe like you all turnt and stuff and then you hear a ad talking about if you watch the ad its 30min of no ads which is misleading because it's only like four 3 to 2 min songs long which I hate I just love being able to pick which music I wanna listen to so if you get spotify I 100% rec premium",negative
"The app is super glitchy, crashes all the time, restarts podcasts all the time and the fact that it blacks out video is extremely irritating. EDIT. This app is still absolute garbage.",negative
its good but I don't like the fact ive to pay to choose what song i can listin too,negative
"Allow Bluetooth access to control nearby devices? Even if I select yes it pops up everytime I go back to the app, even if I'm still using the app and didn't reopen it. Why do you need Bluetooth access to control nearby devices?",negative
Add more old tamil songs from 1990 to 2015... Many songs are missing.. Add Original Soundtrack ( OST ) from respective owners please.,negative
"I have had them since they first came out and they have only got better and better. There isn't a song I can't find on here and my music library in my head is limitless, so that's HUGE. THANKS Spotify!!",negative
"This app is fine, I like that I can listen to music without paying, but there are too many ad's. And you only get six skips per hour. It's also hard to find the song that you searched for, and most of the time to get to it, you have to use your six skips, and you can't even get it half the time.",negative
"Love the app in general, but there is a problem with the podcast system. Spotify does not moderate it's content when it comes to big players like Joe Rogan. It will take down smaller podcast episodes that intentionally spread misinformation, but JR's episodes that spread conspiracy theories and even feature hate groups (is, the proud boys). While I do not believe in governmental censorship, Spotify needs to take responsibility for the content that they are choosing to promote as exclusive.",negative
I've had Spotify for 3 years now and I love it. Awhile back I had some issues with the web player version of it but after a time of little to no use from the app it fixed itself and now works wonderfully and gives me everything I need at the click of a button.,positive
This app keeps on getting worse you only have like 6 skips q day it'd just annoying I have to use premium ðŸ˜’,negative
It's a pretty good app to listen music on.,positive
"I just paused a song and went to do some errands on another app. When I come back, all of my queue and now playing song is gone and it just reset to the home screen. So annoying!",negative
Grateful for such a great service,positive
I've had Spotify for about 2 to 3 weeks and it's seems great and is better than I thought it was going to be.,positive
Very good for listening to music very easily thank you,positive
Ugh. What the heck is going on Spotify? Your interface keeps getting worse. I don't get the interface anymore that provides pause and skip functionality. The app stops randomly.,negative
"I love this app. Even if only having 6 skips per hour is inconvenient, the app more than makes up for it with its capabilities this is the best music app I've found thus far.",positive
Awesome music choices and almost any Artist u could think of!,positive
Great app everything seems to work as it should,positive
I love Spotify! Great variety of music for all ages! Thank you Spotify for the many hours of happy listening that you provide me with!,positive
Keeps crashing when I open it.,positive
Amazing,positive
Good one soft,positive
Now i absolutely love this app but when I go to play a playlist it plays random songs I never put in my playlist and it gets annoying when I have to waste my skips on songs I never added to my playlist. Honestly I would love if you could fix this thank you.,negative
I have no complaints does all I want it to and does it well.,positive
Dear Spotify.... I have a 62hr long playlist. If I wanted to hear the same song 2x in 1hr..... I'd have a 1hr playlist. Please fix the shuffle option to shuffle through the entire playlist before repeating the same song. I can't possibly be the only person unhappy with this.,negative
The so good with good music,positive
"I can't live without Spotify,i love it",positive
Ye konsa sa update LA diya ek Dum bear,positive
Good ,positive
"Its alright without premium, but its AWESOME with premium",positive
Crashes often. Won't let me listen to offline stuff unless I'm online. Just not a good app.,negative
It's phenomenal...The recommendations and variety of audio it touches is very good and the lyrics with share option is cherry on top. Good work. You may add 3D songs too..,positive
It sucks I use it when i can't find a certain thing on SoundCloud but that's about it. It's pretty trash,negative
I don't ever have any issues listening. I specially love the addition of lyrics.,positive
I'm looking forward having the equivalent of qobuz within Spotify some day. But until then I very pleased from the app and the recommendation engine and the Playlist generated for me. Already 6 years a customer;-),positive
I think Spotify is great and easy to use I just love it.,positive
"I hate this ap I hate what you did to Google Music, that app was perfect. Making me search for the music/podcasts I have downloaded because I know I'm about to be without service is ridiculous. Anything less than good wifi or full mobile reception, and songs will cut in and out. And the ads. I paid for premium ffs. I hate you with every fibre",negative
Songs added to my favorite list without my permission and not able to play favorites.,negative
I can't fathom how anyone at Spotify thought it was a good idea to remove the feature that lets you preview songs while creating playlists. Then there's the matter of audio quality which is a level behind youtube music,negative
"It's a great app, but! There is a downside. I can not get the song I want when I play it on my playlist, it goes to a song that Spotify added! I hate all of the songs that they added and I want to play ONE SIMPLE SONG BUT WHE. I PLAY THEM THEY ARE PLAYLISTS WITH HIDDIOUS SONGS. Fix this",negative
There are too many prblm with the quality of song as of changing quality to very high but still unsatisfied 101% much apk is resso I suggest to continue with resso,negative
Thanks to Team Very best and vast collection of old and new songs super,positive
Love This App So Many Great Songs Here,positive
"With premium it's good. Without it, we don't talk about it, but even with premium the shuffle algorithms like to pick the same songs over and over",positive
It's an amazing music application. Its having all latest music.,positive
It sucks I can't play any songs I downloaded it plays a different every time and you can't even rewind really I've never seen an app so poorly created ðŸ˜‘,negative
Awesome leading into Epic. Music dreams satisfied and expanded. I â¤ï¸ Spotify without a doubt. X,positive
I have been using this amazing app for 2 years now and I have no complaints.I have never used a better music app in my life.,positive
I'm getting a little Fed up and tired of added songs onto my playlist or albums that I want to listen to on this program and it gets very very old very very fast and I can't even get to where I can listen or put on songs to play,negative
"I love Spotify,but I really don't like that their getting rid of the some good songs that I like. Like the remix of CoryxKenshin horse montage.",negative
The best app for music. We all love it and my dream is to also make an app like yours. I am also a programmer.,positive
Lots of nice content and now they got the lyrics,positive
Paid accounts still have advertisements on podcasts,negative
Needs an update keeps pausing abruptly other that great 5 star,positive
Love the variety of artists and personalized suggestions. My playlists keep me sane these days!,positive
"I like Spotify, but why does the free plan force you to play music on shuffle? That's dumb. Why should I have to listen to a bunch of other songs before I get to listen to the one I wanted? You do realise how dumb that sounds, right?",negative
"Spotify! So brilliant, you can search and select any songs. You can create a music diary which you can use time and time again. I have my Romantic mix, R&B mix, pop mix, etc.",positive
"Excellent service, much better than the competition, Google music, Amazon, Etc.",positive
no option to disable data access while enabling wifi access. it just ate 312 MB out of my 3GB plan for 1 podcast that I had downloaded on wifi already. can't trust that app anymore. buggy and takes too much ram to run.,negative
Great for road trips and working! I enjoy making my own playlists as well as listening to the suggestions that Spotify comes up with based on my previous plays. The family membership helps cut costs as well. I can share music with my husband and vice versa!,positive
"Apparently, unlike the desktop version you can't actually listen to the songs you want unless you pay for a premium membership. Why even allow me to select my playlists to listen to if you're just going to make me listen to random songs anyway!? Absolutely useless.",negative
This app so great full app and my favourite also and thank you for your hard working in the app to have us ðŸ˜Š we are so enjoy the music â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,positive
"Just love this app ,no complain on the scale of 1 to 10 this app is 11",positive
Easiest to navigate through and has most songs I like listening to...,positive
This is the best music player app i never seen before.,positive
"I have been trying for months to renew my subscription, and nothing has changed. I have used multiple cards to see if I could renew the payment and the same response. It's a disappointment and you need to fix your account issues cause trying with multiple banks shows they are not the problem. I'm still giving 3 stars cause I love the app despite all that has happened.",positive
Excellent platform with endless music to explore. An awesome feel good app.ðŸ˜·ðŸŒðŸ‘â¤.,positive
"Great playback, and good for creating playlists. Plays well through echo devices too.",positive
Bad app behavior. The app won't properly play music and or podcasts. The display of currently playing song gets stuck on a podcast even when I navigate away and try to play something else it's still stuck on the podcast. Spotify doesn't have support apparently so you just chat with this bot who tells you to reinstall the app. I've done that three times but still issues persist. At this point the app is unusable to me literally so not really sure what to do with the $11 a month I pay,negative
"After I switch to premium account, there is problem with opening the app sometimes. That's really annoying ðŸ˜¥ðŸ¥´",negative
Just great liove 50's and 60's music got all I wanted to hear!!,positive
Good to listen to podcasts with internet access and also with out internet access,positive
"I love this app. No complaints here. I do wish there were more songs and remixes of certain artists, but I'm sure it's something settled between the artists and their labels. As a consumer, I hope Spotify hears me out. All I'm requesting is to add in an option, an automatic programming, to remove copies of songs from playlists. It would allow me, and probably several consumers around the world, to save a lot of time trying to edit our playlists.",negative
"Glitchy as Hell! Used to work fine, but lately it randomly cuts out and skips. Player controls randomly stop working or disappear entirely forcing me to shut down the app in order to pause.",negative
Best App For Music. Has all the songs of the world including Anime and TV series as well. Loved it.,positive
Spotify is just shutting off every time I'm on Instagram at the same time as playing music.,negative
Lately Spotify has been full of glitches and won't play my downloaded music when I am offline what is with that! I literally pay for this app SMH!!,negative
Full with Entertainment,positive
"As others here have mentioned, the app is quite buggy. Constantly stopping playback for no reason, playbar freezing, and play button refusing to start songs. I'm currently looking for a different streaming service as Spotify refuses to ammend this issue and its gotten to the point where I spend more time fixing the app than listening to my favourite podcasts and music.",negative
Great music platform use it all the time !!,positive
"Excellent for podcasts. Can download in advance. Wish I could easily delete old downloads, but still a fantastic app I use everyday.",positive
Failure to launch. Even after multiple unistall and reistall doesn't get passed icon screen. 0/5 stars not Samsung friendly.,negative
As of lately it just stops playing music by itself. I have no lost of internet connection but the music just stops for no reason.,negative
"there's a new update that i absolutely hate. when u want to add more songs to ur playlist, u can't hear the lil snippet of the song like u used to. that rlly gets on my nerves bc i don't want to go search up the song on YouTube before adding it to my playlist. please change it back. i also have a free account, but if this has become just a premium feature, then im deleting Spotify. this update angers me a LOT. also, why five ads in a row after every two songs?",negative
"No idea what's going on, but since the last update, Spotify just randomly stops for no reason, then continues playing when I open my phone",negative
"Ever since the last update, the app will play for 20 minutes or so and then just stop. And not just stop where you can go in and the last episode of a podcast you were listening to is readily available in your home screen. You have to go in and find the right one again, only to have it crash again in a few minutes. I wish I had never updated the thing, as I really don't see how this is an improvement",negative
I Love using this app..listening to music while working is nice..thank you for this. ..,positive
"3 ads every 2nd song, worst music app, download mod apk if you like this app but don't use original",negative
Awesome app. Just reduce the number of adsðŸ˜„,negative
I love this app and love listening to music on it just I have one current problem with it when I try add a song to one of my playlists It won't give the option to preview a bit of the song before adding it.,negative
Very useful app fo music lovers,positive

Lets me play high quality recorded music without as many interruptions than any other music platform,positive
Awesome,positive
Love it and it doesn't recommend some music from India that I might be interested in like pandopa,positive
"So buggy it's unuseable. Most of the time you cannot pause or change music and have to keep restarting the app... They should pay people to use their garbage app, it's not even worth it if it was free.",negative
Its 2022 & High time to introduce Lossless audio option on Spotify. Come on!!,negative
"It's a really good app and I love it! The only minor concern I have is the ads, but that's all! â¤",positive
"Wow,I got to here my friend sing on Spotify and it was great ðŸ‘",positive
All of a sudden the app will not work on my S22+,negative
THE BEST MUSIC APP EVER! I WOULD GIVE IT INFINITE STARS!!!!,positive
I used to love this app..even though it had some adds..my music was in order. But the new update made it so worse..I can't even play a song and when I use my own album..it wants me to use in shuffle play!! And I have like six skips an hour!...worst app!!,negative
Great app. Wish I could add multiple tracks from a playlist at the same time to another playlist. It's very annoying having to do this on a pc and not on my phone.,negative
"This app used to be amazing, but lately, it keeps shutting itself down. It started on my S20 and continued to do so after my upgrade to my S22 Ultra.",negative
